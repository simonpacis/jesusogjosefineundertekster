1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,756
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,679
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,637
Okay.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,719
After the showdown with Thorsen in the desert
Jesus and Josefine arrive -

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,959
- along with Simon and Judas
early in the morning in Nazareth.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,355
They say goodbye to Simon and Judas.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,474
- Thanks for the ride.
- Same to you. And thanks for the help.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,757
- Farewell, Josefine.
- Behave yourself now.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,191
- What do you mean?
- That's none of my business.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,956
Mary and Joseph embrace Jesus,
as he returns.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,277
Jesus says he's looking forward
to being a carpenter's apprentice.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,391
You are the chosen one, after all.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,798
It'll be a long time before you're called.
That's what the beggar said.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,999
- Jesus should be allowed to grow up.
- Josefine says goodbye to Jesus.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,513
And travels back to the present.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,996
The world is normal again,

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,668
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,474
Josefine hurries over to Oskar.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,995
- Hi, Josefine.
- Good to see you.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,838
Congratulations! You did it.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,033
- Then Josefine goes home.
- You arrive just in time for dinner.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,879
Uhm, rice pudding.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,471
- Weren't we supposed to have Nazareth juice?
- What is Nazareth juice?

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,592
But outside the window —

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,110
- Thorsen is keeping an eye on the house.

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,992
on her pillow thoughts line up

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,670
planted in the ground like flower seeds

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,159
shoots and sprouts and winds around

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,990
she understands nothing at all

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,954
hours feel like days

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,550
and weeks a thousand years

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,632
came to look back

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,468
to a world of yesterday

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,708
Jesus and Josefine

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,038
homeless heartache

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,519
but Jesus makes Josefine

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,156
believe in miracles

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,079
when she wavers

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,990
Jesus and Josefine

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,716
faithless time machine

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,438
the tempter's concubine

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,473
she needs miracles

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,913
when she wavers

44
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,837
Dad, the calendar candle
has only burned down to the 18th.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,350
We've apparently been so busy
that we've forgotten it.

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
And I've forgotten my calendar gift.

47
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,916
- Why did you throw out the baking bible?
- No one wanted to publish it.

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,114
- Of course there's that.
- Look here. Do you know what this is?

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,074
- Rejection after rejection.
- Have you dropped your cookbook?

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,430
Yes, but it's totally okay.

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,199
It's nicer to bake for you all
than to go and write a stupid book.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,356
I'll keep it then.

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,110
Josefine, we're going to have to
talk about your birthday.

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,394
We had agreed to throw a party for you,
after you had performed the nativity play.

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,796
We can't manage to arrange it.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,313
We're going to have to
postpone it to next year.

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,433
- That's okay.
- Just listen for a moment.

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,953
Next year we'll throw
a mega birthday party for you.

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,039
Dad, it's more important
to celebrate Christmas than my birthday.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,632
- How sweet you are.
- Josefine, pine needle in your hair.

61
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,389
- By the way, I've washed your costume.
— Thanks.

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,957
(rustling)

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,592
- Hi, Oskar.
- Hi, Josefine.

64
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,153
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it just needs a wash.

65
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,920
Then it's good that you're cleaning it.

66
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,112
What about you? Are you okay?

67
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,757
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

68
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,833
Oskar, I'm really glad that
we two managed to make the world normal again.

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,350
- Without you, then …
- Without me, what then?

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,590
Nothing.

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,876
Do you remember when you asked
if we should be boyfriend and girlfriend?

72
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,071
Yes,

73
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,070
— I was thinking that …
- I'm glad that we're friends.

74
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,430
Me too.

75
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,393
Come on, we need to go over and rehearse in the church.

76
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,157
(sighs)

77
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,272
Yes, but then I'll say thanks for today.

78
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,836
I think it'll be
a really nice performance.

79
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,474
And remember, see you tomorrow.

80
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,197
(faint mumbling)

81
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,111
- Oskar and Josefine, can you stay a bit?
- What for?

82
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,073
Now we'll just wait
until the others have left.

83
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,556
I just wanted to say thanks.

84
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,280
- Thanks for what?
- For the flat package with the feather in it.

85
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,315
- Did I give you the flat package?
- Yes, don't you remember?

86
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,717
I couldn't understand either
where it had gone.

87
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,669
I got it once
from an angel in a dream.

88
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,111
The next morning it was really there.

89
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,672
Oskar, can you come up here quick?

90
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,353
- Oskar, see you later,
- Yes, of course.

91
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,199
"See you later,"

92
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,518
I think you should rehearse
the last scene alone.

93
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,033
It can be better. It's about
getting into the heart of Joseph.

94
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,678
And into the heart of Mary.
And you can do that best alone.

95
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,156
I just need to go up and get something,
you can just start.

96
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,716
Come on, Josefine.

97
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,435
Jytte?

98
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,034
- Who are you?
- I'm a nightmare.

99
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,711
Why are you upset?

100
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,196
Maybe I don't want
us to just be friends.

101
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,311
Why not?

102
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,514
Because I might be in love.

103
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,632
Are you still in love with Jesus?

104
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,594
No, Oskar.
Maybe I'm in love with …

105
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,995
Ha!

106
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,352
- What was that?
- No idea.

107
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,676
Jytte?

108
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,518
- I'm damn tired of that name.
- Thorsen!

109
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,150
Hi there. It's almost nice
to see you again.

110
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,434
— A bit like the old days.
- What do you want? This is a church.

111
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,794
- Not a place for you.
- And why not?

112
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,235
It's your fault.
Up there hangs your good friend.

113
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,236
Come.

114
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,993
(laughs)

115
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,875
- Shall I close the doors?
- Get lost, Thorsen!

116
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,036
Let's leave it. You've lost anyway.

117
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,756
Yes, you're right, Oskar. I've lost.

118
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,430
But I don't want to leave
without taking you two with me!

119
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,632
That pleasure
I won't be cheated out of!

120
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,957
Shall I open the doors for you?

121
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,152
(explosion)

122
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,796
Now you two are going down to
the deepest coal cellar.

123
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,594
There you can shovel coal
the rest of your lives.

124
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,597
(Thorsen laughs maliciously)

125
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,758
Help!

126
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,477
Hold on!

127
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,912
You can do nothing!
My power is greater than yours.

128
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,480
- We must trust in God.
- Trust in God?

129
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,955
Yes, just like Jesus said.

130
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,715
Our Father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come.

131
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,710
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

132
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,831
Stop that!

133
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,953
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses.

134
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,073
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

135
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,396
Stop it now!

136
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,639
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory
forever. Amen!

137
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,234
(Thorsen screams)

138
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,588
(doors slam)

139
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,991
Are you okay?

140
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,597
What about Jytte?

141
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,434
(banging sounds)

142
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,429
Let me out. Let me …

143
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,391
Hi there.

144
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,515
I must have stumbled into the closet
somehow.

145
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,948
Have you practiced your scene?

146
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,749
Yes. We've gotten good at it.
Right, Oskar?

147
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,598
Yes,

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,873
- We accidentally knocked over a set piece.
- We have to put it up before we leave.

149
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,996
(sighs)

150
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,396
(Jytte shudders)

151
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,033
Yes. Now I think it's nice here again.

152
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,832
(the door opens)

153
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,472
Hi!

154
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,512
Hi, Lukas.

155
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,109
- Hi, Lukas.
- Hi, Louise.

156
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,596
How nice it is.
And everything is ready for tomorrow?

157
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,872
- Yes, more or less.
- We hope so.

158
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,799
There's nothing wrong, right?

159
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,472
No.

160
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,719
That's good. A fuse could have
blown or something.

161
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,468
Lukas, wouldn't you like
to be in our nativity play?

162
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,513
- As what?
- Then you'd play baby Jesus.

163
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,397
- In Egypt. Instead of the doll.
- I'd like that. Jesus is my friend.

164
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,149
That sounds fun, huh?
Josefine, do you want to come now?

165
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,197
There's something
I need to ask. Come, Lukas.

166
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,272
- Well, thanks for the help.
- Likewise.

167
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,836
I'm glad that we're friends,

168
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,709
Me too.
Do you remember what you promised yesterday?

169
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,629
About the nativity play? It's ruined.

170
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,832
Okay. That's good.

171
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,834
- Dad, I'm going to play Jesus.
- How nice.

172
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,669
- What is my nativity play doing there?
- You're not supposed to know that at all.

173
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,271
- What did you use it for?
- Oh, it was supposed to be a surprise.

174
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,394
- Wow, how nice.
- Can you eat it?

175
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,751
- Not until the day after tomorrow.
- Shall we go down to Jesus?

176
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,758
You're not going anywhere
until you've set the table.

177
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,316
Sorry if I took something I wasn't supposed to.

178
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,752
I just needed
a model for my cake nativity play.

179
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,110
Just ask next time.

180
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,800
It's quite special
that it lights up when you touch the manger.

181
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,834
- Is there a secret bulb somewhere?
- Yes, down in the manger.

182
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,397
Why is there no baby Jesus
in the manger? There is in my cake house.

183
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,797
My Jesus is gone. That's just how it is.

184
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,911
Thanks for the loan.

185
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,558
Dear God in Heaven.

186
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,039
I'm glad we managed to send
Thorsen down to the bottom boiler room.

187
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,708
I'm also glad
that we're friends again, -

188
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,912
- even though I'd rather
have been boyfriend and girlfriend.

189
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,590
- Why are you whispering?
- That's none of your business.

190
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,553
- Those who whisper, lie.
- That's not true.

191
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,280
But if we can't be boyfriend and girlfriend,
then it's okay, we're friends, Amen.
