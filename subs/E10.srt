1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,875
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,709
Okay. Josefine visits Jesus.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,356
Hi, Josefine.
We're heading off right away.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,076
She thinks they're going to look deeply
into each other's eyes, but Jesus has other plans.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,754
The gladiator Pardos has come to
Nazareth and is going to perform for the Romans.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,238
But none of the Roman soldiers
dare challenge Pardos.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,635
- Jesus dares.
- I dare, sure.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,831
I don't fight against children.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,111
Come on then. Come on.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,431
- He fights bravely, but…
- Jesus, watch out.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,957
Watch where you're standing.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,792
Meanwhile, Joseph finds Josefine's phone
and gets a call from Oskar.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,956
- Is that the angel?
- The angel?

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,515
Oskar asks who he was talking to,

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,190
I called, and then I got hold of someone
named Joseph.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,356
He had never talked on a mobile.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,475
And the family is a bit surprised
that a guy named Jesus…

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,753
- Josefine, it's Jesus.
- … Says he has her phone.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,918
It's not his fault,
he's named Jesus.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,434
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,633
laid in the ground like flower seeds

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,994
shoots and sprouts and winds around

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,910
she understands nothing at all

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,954
hours feel like days

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,075
and weeks a thousand years

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,308
came to look back

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,274
to a world of yesterday

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,508
Jesus and Josefine

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,872
homeless heartache

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,313
but Jesus gets Josefine

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,876
to believe in miracles

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,958
when she wavers

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,836
Jesus and Josefine

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,477
faithless time machine

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,277
the tempter's concubine

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,838
she needs miracles
and love

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,476
when she wavers

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,035
(egg timer rings, and baking tray is taken out)

39
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,992
- Would you like more coffee?
— Yes please.

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,236
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,956
- Look, I've baked Jesus-buns.
- Now stop teasing her.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,996
I'm not teasing. I'm glad
Josefine has become friends with Jesus.

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,790
Mm.

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,590
I just don't understand
where you know him from.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,394
Up at school.

46
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,913
Is his name Jesus,
or is it just something you call him?

47
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,112
Well, I don't think he's been baptized that.

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,198
Many are named Jesus
in Spain and South America.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,198
His parents come
from the south anyway.

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,279
- Where does he live?
- A road called Nazareth Road.

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,992
Nazareth Road? It's very good.
What do his parents do?

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,035
- His father works with wood.
- Oh, he's in the carpentry business?

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,279
- His mother bakes bread and washes clothes.
- Does she bake bread?

54
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,996
You're always welcome
to take your Jesus home.

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,156
That's not my Jesus.

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,069
I'd like to meet Jesus.
Then he can teach me to walk on water.

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,798
Now it's probably not exactly the Jesus
Josefine knows. Right, Josefine?

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,152
Can't I take some of those buns
with me to Jesus?

59
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,876
Those are Jesus buns,
of course you can. Pine needles in your hair.

60
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,317
- Oh, Maria. King Herod is dead.
- Is that true, Joseph?

61
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,311
- Oh, we're going home. Home to Nazareth.
- Why do you say "oh" all the time?

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,719
- It's because it sounds good.
- "Oh, Maria", that sounds beautiful.

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,919
- He doesn't talk like that.
- How then?

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,873
- Like that fool who took your phone?
— Yes.

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,594
- I'd like to say hi to him.
- You don't dare.

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,837
- Are you going to argue for long?
- You're dead, so shut up.

67
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,874
Come on, Josefine, speak properly now.

68
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,110
Now we have to redo the scene. From where
Joseph gets a visit from an angel.

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,278
- Why don't I dare?
- You're a sissy.

70
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,998
Oh, Joseph. Get up.

71
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,397
Take the child and its mother
back to the land of Israel.

72
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,912
For the one who wanted to kill the child
is himself dead.

73
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,433
Oh, Maria. King Herod is dead.

74
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,394
Is that true, oh, Joseph?

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,718
We're going home.
Home to oh, Nazareth.

76
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,476
(doorbell)

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,393
- Hi. You've got new glasses.
- You could say that.

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,875
Hey, watch your eyes.

79
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,837
There's a hole in the gas tank,
so I need to cut a new piece for it.

80
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,076
There.

81
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,798
- Hey, can you use one like this?
- I've never tried.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,869
It's about controlling the fire.
Making the fire your servant.

83
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,629
Fire breaks all chains.
It's very good to know.

84
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,230
You light it up here. Like that.

85
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,396
And extinguish it here.

86
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,637
Fire is actually stronger than iron.

87
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,389
I'll just finish
the shiny pictures, okay?

88
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,512
Yeah yeah, you can fix whatever you want.

89
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,516
There.

90
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,236
(doorbell)

91
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,592
Is anyone here? Hm.

92
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,756
(ding-dong)

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,956
Josefine,

94
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,236
(chimes)

95
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,716
Josefine,

96
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,632
The boy who's okay.
The boy who's okay.

97
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,638
The boy who's okay.

98
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,914
The boy who's okay.
Yes. What is it? What is it?

99
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
You? Are you okay?
Give us back our sight.

100
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,192
- I can't do that.
- Aren't you the boy who's okay?

101
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,517
- No.
- So where is the boy who is okay?

102
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,396
- Come on, give them their sight back, Jesus.
- Jesus?

103
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,194
You are the Jesus who is okay.

104
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,996
Yes. So you could go ahead and
give us our sight back.

105
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,158
- Okay.
- Yes, yes.

106
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,715
Yes, yes.

107
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,480
Oh, oh.

108
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,559
Oh, oh.

109
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,914
Dear God the Father, give these two
blind beggars their sight back.

110
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,435
(astonished exclamations)

111
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,396
- Thank you, Jesus.
- See to it you don't tell anyone.

112
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,398
No, we won't tell anyone.

113
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,512
He gave us our sight back.
He is greater than the king.

114
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,553
Yes, he is greater
than the emperor of Rome!

115
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,958
Yes, he is greater. That's Jesus.

116
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,630
If the Romans hear this,
9 Fi
then they'll come after me.

117
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,676
Josephine,

118
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,396
(chimes)

119
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,233
- I'd like a cell phone.
- Oh, so you would.

120
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,671
Then I could talk to you
when you're not here.

121
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,713
- Hey.
- Oskar, what are you doing here?

122
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,037
- Are we in a nativity play?
- Have you followed me?

123
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,959
- Why didn't you say so?
- I tried.

124
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,072
So that's "Jesus"?

125
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,319
Yes, Oskar, that's Jesus.
The real Jesus.

126
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,596
Are you Jesus?

127
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,031
- Who's he?
- That's Oskar, my little brother.

128
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,994
- I'm taller than you.
- Good for you. We're going now.

129
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,035
Stop! Are you the one they call okay?

130
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,199
- Is this an Asterix movie?
- Answer. Are you the one who is okay?

131
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,994
I think myself,
I'm reasonably okay.

132
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,794
He calls himself greater than the emperor.

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,949
- It's a misunderstanding.
- You two stay away. Take him away.

134
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,349
So you're the little miracle worker
who's been stirring things up in Nazareth lately, huh?

135
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,870
- The boy they call okay.
- Are you perhaps Caesar?

136
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,312
- Pontius Aurelius, if I may.
- Yeah, okay, forget it.

137
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,116
Yeah, I thought as much.
You are him, the one who is okay.

138
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,632
You're well aware that the Roman Empire
doesn't like people at all who -

139
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,354
- mock their emperor, right?

140
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,270
- The Roman Empire will collapse in 400 years.
- The Roman Empire will never collapse!

141
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,634
Tell me, are you trying to
make false prophecies, huh?

142
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,631
The punishment for that is even harsher
than the punishment for miracle-working.

143
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,998
What shall we do with the miracle worker?

144
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,352
Take him to Caesarea tomorrow,
and sentence him to the galleys!

145
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,028
I'm not going on any galley.

146
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,595
Put him in chains.

147
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,868
Remove that one. Like that.

148
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,036
You must not sleep.

149
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,794
We have to free him.

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,710
- But the chain is made of iron.
- We'll find something stronger.

151
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,152
The only thing stronger
than iron is gold.

152
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,352
- Fire. Fire is stronger than iron.
— Fire?

153
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,313
I'll be there in a bit.

154
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,631
Thorsen.

155
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,951
- Did you finish with the glitter pictures?
- Can't I borrow the burner?

156
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,870
- Do you have something you need cut?
- I'd like to learn to use it.

157
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,358
- Yes, but not today, I'm busy.
- When then? Later tonight?

158
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,953
Uh, no. No, that won't work.
I have to work all night.

159
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,631
And besides, cutting torches
aren't for kids.

160
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,156
Oh no.

161
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,756
(cell phone rings)

162
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,036
- Josefine?
- Are you okay?

163
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,199
No, I'm not okay at all.
You have to get me out of here.

164
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,393
— Not until tomorrow.
- Then I'll be sentenced to the galleys.

165
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,639
- We'll get you out.
- What about my parents?

166
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,118
- Call and say you're sleeping at my place.
- How is there cell signal?

167
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,711
It must be the crib,
that works as a transmitter.

168
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,912
Just hope we don't get a huge bill.

169
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,150
Oskar, see you.

170
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,510
(the guards chat)

171
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,316
Here you go.

172
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,636
What is that?

173
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,516
(Jesper clears his throat)

174
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,837
- Welsh Christmas pudding.
- Why is it green?

175
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,876
It's crushed peppermint leaves.
Chocolate sauce on top. Here you go.

176
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,629
What did it mean
to be sentenced to the galleys?

177
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,594
- Are you interested in the Roman Empire?
- Maybe a little.

178
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,439
It was a quite normal punishment, -

179
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,476
- given to pickpockets, prisoners of war, and
others who got in trouble back then.

180
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,878
- What's a galley?
- Some huge, flat rowboats.

181
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,757
They sailed around the Mediterranean filled
with slaves who had to row in rhythm.

182
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,988
And there was one beating a drum.
And if they didn't row, they got whipped.

183
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,558
In return, I think they got
some proper biceps from rowing.

184
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,513
Maybe
I should make a galley cake.

185
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,677
There's not much grey hair involved
in making a galley cake.

186
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,314
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to bed.

187
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,273
- It's only half past six.
- But I'm tired.

188
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,436
Goodnight.

189
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,752
Dear God. Just let me save
Oskar from the galley tomorrow.

190
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,350
- Do you have galleys?
- Hush, Lukas.

191
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,315
- I want galleys too.
- I don't have any galleys, so go to sleep.

192
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,154
It just has to work.

193
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,512
Otherwise I don't know
what to do. Amen.
