1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,113
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,149
Jesus is back in Nazareth. Josefine
has promised Oskar not to visit him.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,874
Lukas has an elf hat for Jesus.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,072
- Josefine can give it to him.
- I want to do it myself.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,990
Lukas runs away from kindergarten
and makes his way to Thorsens' shop.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,432
Lukas gives the elf hat to Jesus,
who has healed some lepers.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,631
You have to put it on.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,072
Josefine contacts Jesus
and gets him to send Lukas home.

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,319
- They want you home.
- I have to fetch my little brother.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,671
- Hi, Lukas.
- Hi, Josefine.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,238
In the evening, Jesus has a vision.
His hands begin to bleed.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,352
Jesus calls Josefine
and wants to meet.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,677
I've experienced something strange.
We have to meet tomorrow.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,839
In her evening prayer, Josefine confesses
that she has to break her promise to Oskar -

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,713
- and travel to Jesus one last time.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,515
- And I want to come along.
- One trip to Nazareth should be enough.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,312
Aw!

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,511
I have to know
why Jesus sounded so strange.

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,837
Just hope nothing serious has happened to him.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,240
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,592
laid in the soil like flower seeds

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,715
shoots and sprouts and winds around

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,629
she understands nothing at all

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,752
hours feel like days

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,156
and weeks a thousand years

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,470
came to look back

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,476
to a world of yesterday

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,236
Jesus and Josefine

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,831
homeless heartache

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,478
Jesus makes Josefine

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,558
believe in miracles

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,637
when she wavers

33
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,030
Jesus and Josefine

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,677
faithless time machine

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,954
the tempter's concubine

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,553
she needs miracles
and love

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,433
when she wavers

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,875
- Aw, there's such a long time until Christmas!
- There's only seven days left.

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,390
- That's a lot.
- Snatch one of dad's Christmas sausages.

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,912
- Christmas farts?
- No, Christmas sausages from Vendsyssel.

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,908
Well, Josefine.
We need to talk about something very important.

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,669
- Your birthday.
- When did it become important?

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,078
- It has always been important.
- I don't remember that.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,909
I've been thinking,
after you've performed the nativity play, -

45
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,790
- to invite everyone here home
for a couple of hours. Oskar and the class.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,393
- That's Christmas Eve. They won't come.
- You could invite Jesus along.

47
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,070
I'm going over to him today,
so I'll ask.

48
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,716
Come on, Lukas,
now we have to go to kindergarten.

49
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,230
I have the big meeting
with the publisher today.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,634
Are you meeting Jesus today?
Say hi to him.

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,229
Mom? What would the world be like,
if there was no Christianity?

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,557
Whoa, that … That's a big question
so early in the morning.

53
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,710
One could say that if we were lucky,
we would have another religion, -

54
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,391
- that could help us understand
how the world fits together.

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,470
But if we were unlucky …
we would wander around in a spiritual darkness.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,035
And believe in nothing.

57
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,917
I don't feel like answering that.

58
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,429
Come on, Jytte.

59
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,076
If Christianity
hadn't existed …

60
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,273
… Then I think
we would have been lost.

61
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,315
Yeah, then … then I think
the evil one would have gained power over us.

62
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,553
Jesus Christ is the truth.

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,832
Only through him can we find salvation.

64
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,828
— Would you abolish Christianity?
- No, she won't.

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,113
Now we'll take the nativity play
right from the start. Come.

66
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,836
Jytte …

67
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,397
- I need to go to the toilet.
- We'll just get ready in the meantime.

68
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,555
- Hi, Thorsen.
- Hi, Josefine.

69
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,834
- You're certainly busy today, huh?
- I'll be back lightning fast.

70
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,828
So we'll see who comes back first.
You or me.

71
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,311
What do you mean?

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,116
Maybe I'll be done expanding
before I see you again.

73
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,914
No, you're not that fast.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,150
I'm looking forward to celebrating the expansion
with a really good cup of coffee.

75
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,989
- See you,
- Yeah, we will.

76
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,317
Oskar, I'd like to
talk to you for a moment.

77
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,237
I was visited by an angel last night.

78
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,510
The angel told me that you and Josefine
have a friend who lives far away.

79
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,756
Yeah,

80
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,556
The angel said
that your friend is having a hard time right now.

81
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,789
But he has to deal with
his problems himself. That's important.

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,150
Do you understand that?

83
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,549
He must not be disturbed. The angel
is afraid that you will visit him.

84
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,798
- I understand.
- Good. Because I don't, actually.

85
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,514
Oskar, shall we go together?

86
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,389
I can't anymore.

87
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,956
There were wounds here and here,
What did that mean?

88
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,830
- It was just a dream.
- I was awake.

89
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,398
- You're keeping something secret from me.
- Jesus, you have to lend a hand.

90
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,831
We've got a huge order
all the way from Caesarea.

91
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,797
The Roman centurion will only use
the carpenter whose son has fingers of fire.

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,594
- What are we making?
- Crosses.

93
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,078
They've caught a bunch of pirates.
They're going to be hanged.

94
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,876
- Crosses …
- Oh well … Why not?

95
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,036
Come on.

96
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,870
(metal door slams)

97
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,230
So, Oskar? Do you want to work here after all,
now that I'm expanding the shop?

98
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,159
No, not really.

99
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,592
Have you seen Josefine here today?

100
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,954
Josefine? Nah.
I haven't seen anything of her.

101
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,751
- Are you sure?
- Of course. Do you think I'm lying?

102
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,273
- I'll just go around and check.
- Like hell you will. Out.

103
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,393
Get out of here, you little rascal!

104
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,671
Out with you!

105
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,351
It's wrong
to make crosses for the Romans.

106
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,075
They pay well. If we don't
make them, someone else will.

107
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,831
- Just grab hold down there.
- I just think it's wrong.

108
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,679
Do you think it's wrong too?

109
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,269
— Yes.
— Why?

110
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,995
- It is a cross, after all.
- And so what?

111
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,558
- I don't think you should make them.
- But why not?

112
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,796
No particular reason.

113
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,632
- What are you doing, Jesus?
- Is it because I'm going to die on the cross?

114
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,992
If you don't say it,
I won't bother seeing you again.

115
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,510
Yes, you're going to die on the cross,
but … wait!

116
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,392
No.

117
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,751
Couldn't we
get those crosses finished up?

118
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,317
Is that you again?
Get out!

119
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,671
Maybe I'd like to
work here.

120
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,839
Oh … That's a different tune, huh?

121
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,669
Then I'll get out
an employment contract.

122
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,711
The pay isn't anything to brag about,
but on the other hand, free food.

123
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,758
No!

124
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,993
Come here!
Come here now!

125
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,069
Oskar, you rascal!
You don't do that!

126
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,358
Oskar! You stay here!

127
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,232
Hi.

128
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,674
Didn't we have an agreement that
you wouldn't come down here?

129
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,677
Sorry.

130
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,710
What happened?

131
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,992
- I don't know …
- Why is Jesus upset?

132
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,078
He says we have to leave.

133
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,158
— I'll talk to him.
- I'll come with.

134
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,316
- Is it the Romans who crucify me?
— Yes.

135
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,035
- You mustn't tell him that.
- You have to tell me the truth.

136
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,949
- The crucified one in your mother's church?
- Yes, that's you.

137
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,118
Why are they crucifying me?

138
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,788
Because you're the Son of God.

139
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,152
Then I refuse to be the Son of God.
I want to be allowed to live.

140
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,194
You two stay here!
And if you follow me, then …

141
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,514
- What on earth have I done?
- What's happening?

142
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,273
- Where's Jesus?
- He ran that way.

143
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,630
jesus!

144
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,071
Take it easy.
He'll be fine again.

145
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,118
Maybe.

146
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,389
What's all this commotion?

147
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,036
- Jesus has run away.
- Oh.

148
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,439
I wouldn't have been allowed to
behave like that when I was an apprentice.

149
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,200
But apparently these are new times.

150
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
- See you,
- See you.

151
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,708
- What do we do now?
- We probably shouldn't interfere anymore.

152
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,349
We can only hope
that he becomes good again.

153
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,876
Come.

154
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,990
(heavy thud)

155
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,512
- What is that strange sound?
- No idea.

156
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,392
Come.

157
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,838
Everything here is completely changed.

158
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,559
We can't get out.
What's happening here?

159
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,435
- I don't know.
- It's completely blocked off here.

160
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,951
Try to look.

161
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,637
(metal door slams)

162
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,758
Who let you two slackers off?

163
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,793
- What are you talking about?
- Get to work!

164
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,273
There you are, 47.
We need your labor.

165
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,993
Dad!

166
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,589
- Why do you call me 47?
- That's your name.

167
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,270
My name is Josefine.
And yours is Jesper.

168
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,437
I'm 24.

169
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,952
The one who gave birth to you is 33.
You're 47, now get to work.

170
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,232
The one who gave birth to me…

171
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,757
What is all this?

172
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,909
Steam pressure is dropping!
More speed on the boilers.

173
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,750
See what happens
when you change history.

174
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,318
Jesus doesn't want to be God's son. So
the present gets remade into this.

175
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,870
At least I'll try
to find my family.

176
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,589
Then there's food.

177
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,117
Yuck! It tastes awful.

178
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,790
That's no big deal,
dad.

179
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,152
- Sorry, 24.
- It's food. It just has to be eaten.

180
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,989
- I think it tastes good.
- Eat now, 47.

181
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,909
We have a hard day tomorrow.
Lots of work.

182
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,829
You're supposed to go to the church.
You're a priest.

183
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,873
Priest? What's that?

184
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,834
Don't you know Jesus
or Christianity at all?

185
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,113
- Who's that?
- What about Christmas Eve?

186
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,318
I don't understand
what she's talking about. Christmas Eve?

187
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,837
Then I have my birthday
all to myself.

188
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,873
We don't celebrate birthdays here.

189
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,152
- What about God?
- We are all gods.

190
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,397
Some of us a little more than others.

191
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,953
- Who lives up there?
- The Overboss. The one who is most god-like.

192
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,637
Come. We have to sleep now.
We need to be fresh for tomorrow.

193
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,471
Dear God in Heaven. I've come to
make a real mess of everything.

194
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,233
I hope you'll help me
remake the world, -

195
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,672
- so everything becomes as before, Amen.

196
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,675
- Who are you talking to?
- I'm talking to God, Lukas.

197
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,309
My name is 58, -

198
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,274
- but I like it when
you call me Lukas.

199
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,870
That's good, Lukas,
but now you have to sleep.
