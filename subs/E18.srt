1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,158
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,231
There were wounds here.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,558
Jesus has sent for Josefine.
He must speak with her.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,593
I don't think you should make them.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,429
- What are you doing?
- Am I to die on the cross?

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,510
Josefine admits to Jesus,
that he will die on the cross as an adult.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,555
- Jesus becomes furious.
- Oskar, I want to talk to you.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,877
Jytte has been visited by an angel
and warns Oskar.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,198
The angel said,
that your friend is having a hard time right now.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,359
- You must not visit your friend.
- He must handle his problems himself.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,111
Oskar goes to Nazareth
to bring Josefine home.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,678
- Jesus doesn't want to be God's son.
- I want to be allowed to live.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,476
He wants to decide over his own life
and runs away.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,958
When Josefine and Oskar return,
the world has changed.

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,473
Josefine's family knows nothing about
Christmas or God.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,356
- You're number 47. Get started!
- They don't celebrate birthdays either.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,872
The world has become like this,
because Jesus doesn't want to be God's son.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,275
We have changed the story.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,600
In her evening prayer, Josefine prays
for help to change the world.

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,954
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,199
laid in the soil like flower seeds

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,599
shoots and sprouts and winds around

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,679
she understands nothing at all

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,519
hours feel like days

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,990
and weeks a thousand years

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,952
came to look back

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,071
to a world of yesterday

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,678
Jesus and Josefine

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,635
homeless heartache

30
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,233
Jesus gets Josefine

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,512
to believe in miracles

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,438
when she wavers

33
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,790
Jesus and Josefine

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,437
faithless time machine

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,509
the tempter's concubine

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,272
she needs miracles
and love

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,675
when she wavers

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,917
Stop it now.
Of course he'll come back.

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,398
He's gone for a trip into the desert
to be alone like last time.

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,194
He simply got so angry.

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,550
Those are crosses too.
How can you make crosses for the Romans?

42
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,070
They're just crosses.
Of course he'll come.

43
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,988
- Has Jesus returned?
- Not yet.

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,829
- We don't know where he is.
- That's not good.

45
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,068
- No. What shall we do?
- There's nothing you can do.

46
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,636
What has been foretold
will not happen.

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,549
The savior who was born
denies to save.

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,151
God will abandon mankind.
From now on, they must live without hope.

49
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,714
Farewell, Maria and Josef.

50
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,076
No, wait a minute!

51
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,595
What shall we do?

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,315
I curse the day,
the girl from the North came here.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,911
- If I see her again …
- It's not Josefine's fault.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,157
Cursed be the day,
she came here!

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,997
- We've searched the whole town. He's gone.
- Just hope nothing bad has happened.

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,318
- I think he'll come back.
- Jesus won't come back.

57
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,513
- Why not?
- The ruler of darkness has lured him away.

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,235
Now we must wait a thousand years
for a new savior.

59
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,193
The time of miracles is over.

60
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,113
- Do you know where he is?
- I know nothing.

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,115
- We have to do something.
- What?

62
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,710
Search the neighboring towns.
Jesus must be somewhere.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,835
Come on, Judas. You search east of
Nazareth. I'll take the towns to the west.

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,519
- 58, 47.
- Dad, stop it.

65
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,151
I've slept like the dead.
That's not so strange either.

66
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,875
Come on now, 47, we're busy,
You have to go to work.

67
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,356
- I'm supposed to go to school.
- I want to go to school too,

68
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,233
Schools …. that's forbidden.

69
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,910
Everyone works.
It's our duty as gods.

70
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,714
There's no spruce in the hair
in this world.

71
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,516
- What does that mean, 24?
- I actually don't know.

72
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,034
- 47 says so many strange things.
- What does it look like outside?

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,472
How would I know.
I've never been outside.

74
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,275
- Aren't you curious?
- Nah.

75
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,119
Come on out and eat your feed.

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,830
He says you know him.
We call him the boy without a number.

77
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,115
- Oskar, are you okay?
- Do I look like it?

78
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,595
Where are your parents?

79
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,439
I must be
in the wrong furnace room.

80
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,200
You won't get any of our feed.

81
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,868
— Shall we look for your parents?
— We'd better remake the world.

82
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,117
We must find the nativity play
and go back to Jesus.

83
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,676
Hello, you there! Aren't you going to shovel coal?

84
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,396
- The steam pressure is too low!
- Come on. Come on.

85
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,477
Come on!

86
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,554
- Look there.
- Look at what?

87
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,318
Jytte!

88
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,557
Come.

89
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,318
Jytte?

90
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,032
Jytte?

91
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,832
Why do you call me Jytte?
My name is 12.

92
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,635
- Sorry. Hi, 12.
- Come, sit down.

93
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,316
Sit down. There.

94
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,759
- What are you all doing here?
- Shh.

95
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,478
We have a little secret school here.
The guards mustn't know anything.

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,797
Hi, Emilie.

97
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,952
My name is 109, by the way.

98
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,993
Today we're going to hear about angels.

99
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,316
Angels are not welcome
here in our world.

100
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,389
Angels are some of the most beautiful
beings that exist.

101
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,434
When an angel comes flying
on its white wings, -

102
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,110
- then my heart fills with great joy.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,393
- Have you seen an angel, number 12?
- Once while I was sleeping, one came.

104
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,429
(door slams)

105
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,270
It told me,
that the world can become different.

106
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,789
Is that true?

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,154
It also told me,
that one day a savior will be born, -

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,831
- who will give faith, hope, and love
to us humans.

109
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,428
We are not humans.
We are gods.

110
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,996
No, we are not gods,
We are humans.

111
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,758
(engine noise)

112
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,476
Overseer, quick!
Come on! Back to your work.

113
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,150
The overseer mustn't see you
with me.

114
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,551
- I want to have a talk with the overseer.
- Me too.

115
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,233
Down on your knees!
Show respect for the overseer!

116
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,196
Thorsen!

117
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,153
47, huh...
you came after all, huh?

118
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,191
Hey there.

119
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,710
You don't have a number at all.
That's how it goes.

120
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,559
You know,
we're called Oskar and Josefine.

121
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,433
Know what?
Not in this world.

122
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,030
What do you think of my extension?
Impressive, right?

123
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,357
- You've tricked me.
- Yeah, and know what?

124
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,839
Isn't it one of existence's little,
fun things, that we can trick each other?

125
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,589
- You're 100 percent psychopath.
- Yeah, and know what?

126
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,509
In this world, "psychopath"
isn't an insult.

127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,474
47... thanks for the help.

128
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,196
And let's see about
getting some coal on that stove!

129
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,792
Are you crazy, 47?
You can't talk like that to the overseer.

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,356
Thorsen is a fool.
He has no right to this.

131
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,393
47 and the boy without a number,
get to it.

132
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,990
- This isn't some beach vacation.
- What's a beach vacation?

133
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,158
I don't know.
I don't care either.

134
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,358
Look, we go that way
to get into Thorsen's shop.

135
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,109
We run over to the nativity scene
and set it up again.

136
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,394
You have to work. Come on, 47
and the boy without a number.

137
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,239
The pressure isn't high enough yet.

138
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,518
No, here.

139
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,079
- The nativity scene is gone.
- It must be somewhere else.

140
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,952
(evil laughter)

141
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,436
You're right about that,
boy without a number.

142
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,599
Do you really think I'm so naive
to leave it standing out here?

143
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,189
Now you two come with me.

144
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,996
There's still a ton of coal
that needs shoveling. Come here.

145
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,998
Be more careful with your mischief
in the future.

146
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,794
Sorry, overseer.
It won't happen again.

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,515
Otherwise you'll be sent down
to the furnace cellar below.

148
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,633
- There's no beach vacation down there.
- We'll keep an eye on them.

149
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,432
You disgusting...

150
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,189
I wouldn't do that,
if I were you, 47.

151
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,789
That reminds me, we need to do
something about that in there.

152
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,233
Tell us more about the angels.

153
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,352
One day they will come down to us -

154
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,553
- and tell us humans
that a savior will be born.

155
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,558
Son of the only God.

156
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,515
Stop that lie story!
It will never happen. Out with you, kids!

157
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,236
Number 12,
you seem to need a trip to solitary.

158
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,749
Then there's food.

159
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,069
It's fine that you help out, but you
don't get any of our food.

160
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,192
- You can have my share of the porridge.
- You decide that yourself, 47.

161
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,315
But don't come tonight
begging for more to eat.

162
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,479
- Dad, show some kindness.
- What does kindness mean?

163
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,309
Don't listen to 47.
She says many words we don't know.

164
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,433
Like 12.
She told about the angels.

165
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,031
And what did she get out of it?
Now she's in the dungeon.

166
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,550
Hi, Judas. You look tired.

167
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,991
I've been all the way to Cana
to look for Jesus.

168
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,670
- Did you find him?
- No. Unfortunately.

169
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,192
Jesus?

170
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,389
- Have you found him?
- No, but I met a caravan.

171
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,910
They had seen a boy walking alone
towards the coast.

172
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,680
It could have been someone else.

173
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,440
They said he looked angry.

174
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,438
What is he going to the coast for now?

175
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,275
Jytte. Hi, Jytte.

176
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,279
- Sorry, number 12.
- It's nice that you call me Jytte.

177
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,951
It's a nice name.
The guards just mustn't hear it.

178
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,675
- Can we help you with something?
- No, thanks anyway.

179
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,192
Around here there are rarely any
who help each other.

180
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,392
Have you heard anything about
a magic nativity play?

181
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,956
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The guard is coming.

182
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,071
Yes, wait a bit!

183
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,671
An angel once whispered in my ear
that the overseer has a magic box.

184
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,316
- Come on, Josefine!
- Did the angel say where it was?

185
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,717
I believe
he has it up with him.

186
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,753
- Okay. Thanks.
- Take care of yourselves.

187
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,396
- What are you doing here?
- They're standing and spitting on me.

188
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,797
Then it's okay.
Just spit away.

189
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,840
Stop it!

190
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,752
See you,

191
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,754
(heavy thud in the distance)

192
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,755
Dear God. Tomorrow you must help us
get up to Thorsen.

193
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,990
We just need to find the nativity play
and then travel back to Jesus.

194
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,310
Who is God?

195
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,793
- It's him who created the world.
- At least not this world.

196
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,230
Thorsen created that one.

197
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,639
But tomorrow we remake it.

198
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,871
Amen.
