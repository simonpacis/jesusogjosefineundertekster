1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,679
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,792
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,797
Okay.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,231
Once upon a time
there was a carpenter and his wife.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,954
His name was Joseph.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,719
And hers was Mary.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,831
They traveled to the city of Bethlehem, -

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,749
- because the emperor in Rome said
that everyone in his kingdom should be counted.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,032
Mary was very pregnant.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,519
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,759
planted in the earth like flower seeds

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,239
shoots and sprouts and twists around

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,991
she understands nothing at all

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,079
hours feel like days

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,829
and weeks a thousand years

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,639
came to look back

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,515
to a world of yesterday

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,396
Jesus and Josefine

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,957
homeless heartache

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,678
but Jesus makes Josefine

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,031
believe in miracles

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,312
when she wavers

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,036
Jesus and Josefine

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,836
faithless time machine

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,591
the tempter's concubine

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,877
she needs miracles

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,799
when she wavers

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,313
(Mary groans)

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,715
We'll make it, Mary. I'll find a place.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,071
- It has to be now.
- Pray to God that he waits a little.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,829
- God wants me to give birth now.
- Here it is.

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,510
I knew it.
I knew it was right here.

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,473
(knocks)

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,668
My wife is giving birth.
We're from Nazareth.

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,030
Everything is full.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,876
Everything is full in Bethlehem.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,278
Now it's not my problem
that the whole world has to be entered in the census.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,516
(Mary whimpers)

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,716
- You can borrow my stable.
- My son shall not be born in a stable.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,559
Yes, it has to be now, Joseph.

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,235
(Mary gasps)

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,512
(baby cries)

43
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,638
- I think he should be named Joseph.
- No, he shall be named Jesus.

44
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,149
The angel said so himself.

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,596
But Joseph sounds
at least just as good as Jesus.

46
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,030
(knocks)

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,912
An angel said
we should find the baby Jesus.

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,998
- Is this it?
— Yes.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,395
Right, Joseph?

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,753
(church bells ring)

51
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,837
Josefine, wake up.

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,348
- Josefine, it's the first of December.
- I don't feel like it.

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,518
Look what I got.
An advent calendar.

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,315
- Don't you have enough elf hats?
- You're grumpy because you don't have one.

55
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,590
Lukas, I don't want one this year.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,873
- You can have a gift from me.
- I don't want it.

57
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,196
No, Lukas, stop.

58
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,631
Lukas, it's forbidden
to have elf hats on my side.

59
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,112
Okay.

60
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,430
(egg timer rings)

61
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,878
- Now there are first-of-December buns.
- How nice they are. It's a miracle.

62
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,676
- They're neither burnt nor anything.
- I didn't look at the recipe.

63
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,509
Who's ready to crack a tooth
on dad's Christmas buns?

64
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,594
- Is there rice pudding in them?
- You don't put that in buns.

65
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,792
There is actually
a little bit of rice pudding in them.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,150
They taste super good.

67
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,158
Now there's just the thing,
that Christmas has been cancelled.

68
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,989
- That's not true, is it?
- Christmas has been moved to Midsummer.

69
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,309
Then I get my birthday to myself.
And your calendar gift doesn't count anymore.

70
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,149
- That's not true, right?
- No, of course not.

71
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,956
Christmas is the children's festival.
And then we celebrate Jesus' birthday.

72
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,153
- Just because you've just become a priest.
- Now I don't know much about Jesus.

73
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,830
But as a schoolteacher, I would know
if Christmas had been moved.

74
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,429
You don't know anything about that,
because you're on leave.

75
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,518
I know exactly what Christmas is.
It's right here.

76
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,712
- I'm holding on to it.
- You have a bad back.

77
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,637
Yeah yeah. Now put some fir in your hair.

78
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,991
It's unfair,
that I have my birthday on Christmas Eve.

79
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,156
I couldn't hold you back.

80
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,956
Last year we sang happy birthday
around the Christmas tree. That was nice.

81
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,715
No one.

82
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,159
You could also say it's cool to have
your birthday the same day as Jesus.

83
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,828
Yeah, enormously cool.

84
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,635
We've offered you that you could
celebrate your birthday another day.

85
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,674
And if you want to invite
your friends home for Christmas …

86
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,271
I don't want to share my birthday with someone
who lived over 2,000 years ago.

87
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,508
- You shouldn't talk about Jesus like that.
- Dad says he maybe didn't exist.

88
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,477
Dad says so much. But no matter what,
Jesus is an incredibly important person.

89
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,558
- I'm also an important person.
— Yes.

90
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,992
You are very important to dad and to me
and to Lukas and your friends.

91
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,351
So what's the problem with
moving Christmas?

92
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,077
Listen. I'm having a busy month
with funerals and christenings, -

93
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,115
- and I have to hold the Christmas service
at 9,
so I really can't handle problems.

94
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,390
But I promise you,
you'll have a good birthday.

95
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,433
Can we celebrate your birthday in the
morning and do a little Christmas in the evening?

96
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,870
(mobile phone rings)

97
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,358
Hi, Oskar. I can only have
birthday in the morning, -

98
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,472
- because Jesus is
much more important than me.

99
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,353
I probably didn't say it
quite like that.

100
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,835
Okay, I'll come over.

101
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,556
- Hi, Oskar.
- Hi.

102
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,073
- Has Stella given birth?
- No, my mom says it'll happen today.

103
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,670
Hi, little Stella.
Belly full of pups.

104
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,996
Actually, I just came
to say goodbye.

105
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,398
- Why do you have to say goodbye?
- I'm leaving here in December.

106
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,434
- May I come with you?
- Yes, but we don't celebrate Christmas Eve.

107
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,430
Christmas is totally forbidden.
But in return, there's Josefine Eve.

108
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,950
Then it'll be without me.
I love Christmas Eve.

109
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,628
But you know that today
we're assigning roles for the nativity play.

110
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,310
I thought that we two
could play Joseph and Mary.

111
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,719
I have a much better idea.
We're going to play the donkey.

112
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,434
The donkey?

113
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,677
We're going to rehearse those roles for
almost a month.

114
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,034
(the phone rings)

115
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,273
That was probably the shepherds
and the holy three kings.

116
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,271
Yes, and we're still missing
King Herod and his helper.

117
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,473
We're missing Joseph and Mary and …

118
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,912
Oh yes, the donkey. Is there anyone
who voluntarily wants to play the donkey?

119
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,636
There's Josefine and Pia and Nina.

120
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,956
We only need two.

121
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,596
- Me and Oskar, we want to.
- I'm not playing the donkey.

122
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,554
Then it'll be Pia and Nina.
You'll be the donkey.

123
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,469
I want to play Herod.
Then Oskar can be my helper.

124
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,276
- Why do you want to play King Herod?
- Because I don't like Jesus.

125
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,075
- Why don't you like him?
- He stole my birthday.

126
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,352
- (everyone sighs in exasperation)
- Yes, Emilie,

127
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,358
Can we skip hearing about
that birthday this year?

128
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,669
I think Josefine would benefit from
playing someone who likes Jesus.

129
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,269
- I think you should play Mary.
- No, really?

130
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,153
- And then Oskar can play Joseph.
- Okay.

131
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,636
And then Emilie can be King Herod.

132
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,030
And, Christina, you can be
King Herod's helper.

133
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,228
And I've allowed myself
to take the role of the angel.

134
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,638
And now look.
Here is old Palestine.

135
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,039
Now, for the next 24 days, we're going to take
a really exciting journey right here.

136
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,274
It was a country
marked by a lot of unrest.

137
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,873
It was a Jewish land
occupied by the Romans.

138
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,793
Look, here is Bethlehem, -

139
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,878
- where Jesus was born.

140
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,517
And here is Nazareth,
where he grew up.

141
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,752
Yes, Josefine?

142
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,714
What if we make the stable so dirty
that Jesus gets sick and dies?

143
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,639
If Jesus had died as an infant,
we wouldn't have gotten to know him.

144
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,834
- And then what?
- Then God couldn't have forgiven us.

145
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,433
And we never would have learned
to forgive each other.

146
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,074
And your mom wouldn't have become a priest.

147
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,670
And we couldn't have done
a nativity play in any church.

148
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,838
Then I could have
my birthday in peace.

149
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,316
Is there really nothing
about Christmas that you like?

150
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,312
When it's over.

151
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,030
- That's fine, you should play Maria.
- Do you really think so?

152
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,118
The Virgin Mary is
an incredibly strong female role.

153
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,276
I just have to sit and say:

154
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,029
"Oh, how sweet he is.
The best child in the world."

155
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,835
They made such
sweet and well-behaved children in Biblical times.

156
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,918
- I want to do a nativity play too.
- Come here.

157
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,079
What do you say to "Jesper's Baking Bible"?

158
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,239
- What are you talking about?
- I want to make a cookbook.

159
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,477
With all the world's Christmas pastries.

160
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,514
- You don't use recipes anyway.
- That's because they're way too difficult.

161
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,190
I want to make simple recipes
that people can understand.

162
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,675
It's about using your common sense.
Then you can bake.

163
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,112
That should be the message of the book.
I think it'll be a huge success.

164
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,108
What about that time you wanted to make
a children's book? Did you get to page 7?

165
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,517
I couldn't figure out
what it should end with.

166
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,359
A cookbook is more me.

167
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,710
Try to support me for once.

168
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,198
Of course we'll support you.
Jesper's Baking Bible is a fucking great idea.

169
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,393
- Let's see if you finish it.
- Of course I will.

170
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,955
(cell phone rings)

171
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,199
- Hi, Oskar.
- You have to help me. Stella is gone.

172
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,470
- I'm coming over.
- Okay.

173
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,316
Stella?

174
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,550
Stella?

175
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,070
Hi.

176
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
I thought it was down there just now.

177
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,196
(dog barks)

178
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,153
- We'd better go out and look.
- Is it these you're looking for?

179
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,918
Hi.

180
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,032
I just found them behind a container.

181
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,837
Then I put them here in the box.

182
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,430
How cute they are.

183
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,279
- What are they?
- Dogoer.

184
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,391
Dogoer?

185
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,954
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

186
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,030
I was passing by anyway.

187
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,677
Bye bye.

188
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,356
Look how small they are.

189
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,629
He was pretty weird.

190
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,355
- Why do you think so?
- I just do.

191
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,037
(wind whooshes)

192
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,479
Dear God, if you exist.

193
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,071
Can't you promise me
to take good care of Oskar's little Dogoer?

194
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,349
And if you really exist,
can you do me that favor -

195
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,758
— to move Christmas to
a different date than December 24th?

196
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,349
- Mom says you can't.
- Lukas.

197
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,716
I can't handle another year, -

198
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,515
- where I can't have
my birthday in peace. Amen.

199
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,389
(door creaks)

200
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,676
Is anyone there?

201
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,598
- It was just a sandstorm.
- I dreamed someone took him from me.

202
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,268
No one would dream of
stealing a little child.

203
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,473
You know perfectly well Jesus is not
just any ordinary child.

204
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,989
We must take good care of him.

205
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,119
For tonight a savior is born.
