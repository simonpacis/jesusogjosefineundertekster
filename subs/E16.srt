1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,998
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,550
Have you figured out where Jesus is?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,878
Jesus has traveled 2000 years into the future
to present-day Denmark.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,232
Jesper has reported Jesus
to the social authorities.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,831
- He thinks he's Jesus.
- That's why he shouldn't be abducted.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,672
Josefine and Oskar discover that Jesus
is at the residential institution Solhuset.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,714
We need to go down to Thorsen
and then find Solhuset.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,549
They visit Thorsen,
who wants to expand his business.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,877
- I need employees.
- They borrow the nativity scene.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,755
Promise me to take good care of it.
It's very fragile.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,475
Over at Solhuset
a psychologist analyzes Jesus.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,357
- Why do you think you're from Nazareth?
- Because that's where I live.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,439
Josefine and Oskar
sneak in to see Jesus.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,155
With the nativity scene, they get
Jesus sent home to Nazareth.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,193
Shall we say goodbye then?

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,951
In Nazareth, Joseph and Mary
are happy to get Jesus back.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,435
Thank you, God, for my son!

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,158
Jesus says that he now understands
what it means to be God's son.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,796
Josefine and Oskar
return the nativity scene.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,391
It's not everyone
who benefits from tinkering with it.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,470
- I am the guardian of the nativity scene.
- Oskar thinks Thorsen is weird.

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,399
Maybe he's Satan.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,228
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,433
laid in the soil like flower seeds

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,794
shoots and sprouts and winds around

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,551
she understands nothing at all

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,832
hours feel like days

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,350
and weeks a thousand years

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,391
came to look back

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,755
to a world of yesterday

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,191
Jesus and Josefine

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,951
homeless heartache

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,553
Jesus makes Josefine

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,558
believe in miracles

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,751
when she wavers

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,110
Jesus and Josefine

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,757
faithless time machine

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,875
the tempter's concubine

39
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,598
she needs miracles
and love

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,314
when she wavers

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,839
- They taste good.
- It's a super simple recipe.

42
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,271
- What do you have there?
- An elf hat for Jesus.

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,950
- Josefine can take it with her.
- I want to give it to him myself.

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,914
- It'll be hard, because he's gone.
- Home to Nazareth?

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,558
- Stop teasing her.
- It's dangerous to go around playing Jesus.

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,230
The last one who did it
ended up on the cross.

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,911
- We don't crucify people in Denmark.
- I'm traveling to Nazareth with his hat.

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,999
First, we two are heading
down to the kindergarten for a visit.

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,397
Are you taking a priest's ear with you?
What, darling?

50
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,272
- What are you thinking about?
- Jesus.

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,074
If you feel like inviting Jesus
home with you, you're very welcome to do that.

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,033
I don't think that'll happen for now.

53
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,114
What are you thinking about?

54
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,517
Josefine. I miss her.

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,799
Look! Over there! Lepers.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,390
- Get lost!
- We don't want lepers here!

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,559
- Why do you say that?
- Do you want to get infected and become crippled?

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,197
- Judas is right, they can infect.
- I don't believe that.

59
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,595
Help us. You must help us.
Help us.

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,518
- Won't you?
- Okay.

61
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,915
Okay.

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,396
Okay.

63
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,395
(angel choir)

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,954
Get up. You are healed now.

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,351
We are healed.

66
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,870
Thank you!
Thank you, you who can heal.

67
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,992
Thank you! It's a miracle,

68
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,188
- It's a miracle.
- We should open a doctor's clinic.

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,153
We can get rich!

70
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,433
No, Judas. There are some things
one doesn't do for money.

71
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,756
Quiet. Any questions
before we start rehearsing?

72
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,430
- Yes, Josefine.
- Why was Jesus crucified?

73
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,871
The nativity play is about
that he was born.

74
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,719
But it's a good question.

75
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,471
Jesus knew that he had to die.
It was part of God's plan.

76
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,432
Why?

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,237
He was crucified because we are cowards
and only think about ourselves.

78
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,750
Instead of avenging himself
he took the blame from us -

79
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,758
- and gave us hope of eternal life.

80
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,919
Three days after he died,
he rose again, you see.

81
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,195
And 40 days later he ascended to Heaven,
where he sits at God's right hand.

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,637
- What if that hadn't happened?
- Then Christianity wouldn't exist.

83
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,196
Then the world
would have looked completely different.

84
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,711
Now we're starting to rehearse.
There aren't many days until Christmas.

85
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,480
We need the soldiers over here.

86
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,394
Hello? I'd like to go to Nazareth.

87
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,753
How do I get to Nazareth?

88
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,796
(glockenspiel and angel choir)

89
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,390
Jesus?

90
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,512
My name is Joseph.
What kind of strange creature are you?

91
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,712
- Hi, my name is Luke.
- Hi.

92
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,072
- I have a nephew named Luke.
- Do you know where Jesus is?

93
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,717
He should help me plane
this, but he's probably outside.

94
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,716
Hi!

95
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,553
- Hi, Jesus!
- Luke, what are you doing here?

96
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,110
I have a gift for you.

97
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,830
You have to unwrap it.

98
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,555
You have to put it on.

99
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,793
Like this?

100
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,552
- NOW it's sitting properly.
- Okay.

101
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,275
- Who is that guy?
— Josefine's little brother.

102
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,233
Yeah, sorry, but …

103
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,629
Jesus … surely that's not how
we're gonna get a bite of bread?

104
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,468
- We haven't eaten for days.
- I have a cake.

105
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,912
- That won't fill them up.
— Can I just borrow that one?

106
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,310
(angel choir)

107
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,630
Thanks a lot.

108
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,435
That's fantastic.
Another miracle. Thanks a lot.

109
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,635
It was good that we got Jesus home.

110
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,076
Imagine if we could make Christianity
disappear.

111
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,716
I just don't feel like
I said a proper goodbye.

112
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,390
- Then send a text.
- Jesus can't text.

113
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,470
- Just don't go down there again.
- I promised.

114
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,913
(phone rings)

115
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,918
— Hi, dad.
- Hi. Have you seen Lukas?

116
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,237
- Why?
- He ran away from kindergarten.

117
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,352
He said
he wanted to give Jesus a gift.

118
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,190
He talked about one
named Thorsen. Do you know him?

119
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,238
- Is something wrong?
- Not at all.

120
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,228
- Hey, now Lukas is coming.
- That's good.

121
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,432
I was about to
get really nervous.

122
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,714
- Say hi and scold him for me.
- I will. Bye bye, dad.

123
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,469
- What's happening?
- Lukas traveled through the time portal.

124
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,513
We have to go to Jesus
and fetch him.

125
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,439
Wait a sec. Just look here.

126
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,829
"The little boy from the land to the North
had a hat for Jesus, -

127
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,158
- and he taught him to turn one loaf
into many."

128
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,079
He gave Jesus the elf hat.

129
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,716
Done with
changing the Bible story.

130
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,879
Call Jesus and make sure
he gets Lukas home.

131
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,472
- Do you mean it?
— Yes.

132
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,636
Call now.

133
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,635
How did you turn one loaf
into many?

134
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,470
We could get filthy rich. We could
bake bread for all of Jerusalem.

135
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,558
That's not what it's about.

136
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,550
Thanks for your bread, Lukas. You've
understood it's about giving.

137
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,672
- And spruce in the hair.
- Spruce in the hair?

138
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,518
Hi, Josefine. Yeah, he's here.

139
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,474
I'll take care of it. Talk later.

140
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,356
They want you to come home.
See you tomorrow. Come on.

141
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,637
Who is that?
And what do you look like?

142
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,918
- Lukas. He's coming with gifts.
- Lukas?

143
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,554
Oh, that cousin from Jerusalem?

144
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,356
- Yeah. And I have spruce in my hair.
— Yeah …

145
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,554
- So how did you get here?
- I traveled by time machine.

146
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,595
Camel caravan.
I'll take him down to the camels.

147
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,152
Yeah,

148
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,911
Then you have to say hi in Jerusalem …

149
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,588
…. Lukas.

150
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,678
- What are those camels?
- Come.

151
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,589
Are you scared of that thing with
dying on the cross?

152
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,679
What are you talking about? I die
as an old man with a long beard.

153
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,553
You'll get a long beard at least.

154
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,154
- Hi, Thorsen.
- Hi, Josefine.

155
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,558
- Have you been here earlier today?
- Nah.

156
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,479
No. I just got here too.

157
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,116
I've been out
clearing a deceased estate.

158
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,189
What do you say then? Now I can finally
get a cup of cappuccino.

159
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,230
Are you going to the back room?

160
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,592
No, not today.
I'm just picking up my little brother.

161
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,031
- Hi, Lukas.
- Hi, Josefine.

162
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,597
- I haven't seen you at all.
- Well, thanks for the ride.

163
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,155
Thanks, you too.

164
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,433
Well, we're going now.
Bye bye, Thorsen. See you.

165
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,314
You won't tell mom and dad
what we've been through, right?

166
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,113
What are you sitting there thinking about?

167
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,710
- Am I going to die on a cross someday?
- No.

168
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,829
What kind of nonsense is that?
Who said that?

169
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,870
You're not going to die on any cross.
Your father up there will take care of that.

170
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,469
You shall be king.

171
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,319
You shall save us all.

172
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,875
(angelic choir)

173
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,478
(thunder)

174
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,835
You can't just
leave the daycare all by yourself, right?

175
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,396
I was going to give Jesus my elf hat.

176
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,752
- Did he have some sweet parents?
- They were very sweet.

177
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,918
- Jesus has completely normal parents.
- Of course.

178
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,237
But I wasn't allowed to
ride the camels.

179
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,196
- Hi, Jesus.
- I've experienced something strange.

180
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,914
We have to meet tomorrow.

181
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,319
- I don't know if that's a good idea.
- We have to meet. I beg you.

182
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,876
Okay, then I'll come over
after school tomorrow.

183
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,874
- Who was that?
— Jesus.

184
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,238
Dear God.
I have to break my promise to Oskar.

185
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,274
Because tomorrow I'm going down to Jesus
for the last time.

186
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,994
- And I want to come.
- No, Lukas.

187
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,272
- One trip to Nazareth has to be enough.
- Aw!

188
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,076
I need to know,
why Jesus sounded so strange.

189
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,034
Just as long as nothing serious has happened to him. Amen.
