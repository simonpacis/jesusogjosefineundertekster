1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,750
Are you sitting comfortably in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,153
Okay. Jesper and Louise ask about
that Jesus that Josefine knows.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,434
- Is his real name Jesus?
- I don't think he's been baptized that.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,553
- Where does he live?
- On a road called Nazareth Road.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,592
Oskar follows Josefine
to Thorsen's shop.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,593
He discovers
the secret of the nativity play.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,317
- Suddenly Oskar shows up in Nazareth.
- Oskar, what are you doing here?

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,193
Is that "Jesus" then?

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,630
, oa
- Come, let's go now.
- Stop!

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,435
- The soldiers capture Oskar.
- Are you the one they call okay?

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,839
- I think I'm pretty okay myself.
- He calls himself greater than the emperor.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,713
- It's a misunderstanding.
- You stay away.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,832
He is put in chains
and sentenced to the galleys.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,600
We have to free him.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,713
Josefine wants to free him
with Thorsen's log splitter.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,593
But Thorsen needs it
all night.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,793
And besides, log splitters
aren't for children.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,554
- Oskar, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay at all.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,151
Josefine promises Oskar
to come and free him tomorrow.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,639
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,833
laid in the soil like flower seeds

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,273
shoots and sprouts and winds around

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,156
she understands nothing at all

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,069
hours feel like days

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,479
and weeks a thousand years

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,549
came to look back

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,514
to a world of yesterday

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,748
Jesus and Josefine

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,158
homeless heartache

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,559
but Jesus makes Josefine

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,036
believe in miracles

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,152
when she wavers

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,070
Jesus and Josefine

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,717
faithless time machine

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,517
the tempter's concubine

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,999
she needs miracles
and love

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,875
when she wavers

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,918
Uh, sorry.

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,314
- May I ask something?
- What now?

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,308
Those galleys,
when will I be sent off?

41
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,156
When the sun is at zenith, and there are no
more shadows on that column there, -

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,150
- then we ship you to the galleys,
and we won't see you until …

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,477
… until you become
old and gray-haired, -

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,196
- and your biceps are
as thick as tree trunks.

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,755
- Did you hear that?
- I'll come up with something.

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,270
I hope so too.
I'm not going out on those galleys.

47
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,517
- Are you talking to yourself?
- I have to run now.

48
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,676
(the phone buzzes)

49
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,635
Do you want a bun?

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,679
- Is something wrong?
- No no.

51
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,635
Hey, Josefine.
Cheer up. Spruce in your hair.

52
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,752
Try smelling them. Good, right?

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,157
Just take a couple
with you to school, okay?

54
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,555
- Are you leaving already?
- Oskar and I agreed to meet early.

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,558
Then we can rehearse the nativity play.

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,595
That's a bit strange,
because Oskar's mom just called.

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,237
And Oskar had called and said
that he was sleeping over at our place.

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,069
- Isn't that strange?
- He was supposed to sleep here.

59
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,794
But then he slept at Emilie's.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,118
- Oh, are you upset about it?
- No no, it's totally fine.

61
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,676
(doorbell)

62
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,476
(Thorsen snoring)

63
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,154
Is that you, Josefine?

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,875
Good morning, Thorsen.
Nice work.

65
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,838
Who says it's a good morning?
Why are you here so early?

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,433
We have the first hours off, so I
wanted to finish the glitter pictures.

67
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,794
You do that, but don't
wake me up this early another time.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,390
- I've been working all night.
- Sorry.

69
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,553
- Hi.
- Oh no, not her again.

70
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,228
- I was waiting.
- It couldn't be sooner.

71
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,194
- What about your little brother?
- I've come up with a genius plan.

72
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,356
Leave me and Simon out of it.

73
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,314
We all have to help,
otherwise Oskar ends up in the galleys.

74
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,239
We'll all help.

75
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,556
They smell good.

76
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,038
Now now, don't eat any.
We need them. Come here.

77
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,755
(Josefine whispers)

78
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,830
So the shadow isn't so tall anymore,
huh, miracle worker?

79
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,838
When the centurion comes,
we'll head out.

80
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,112
- Yeah, after we've had lunch.
— Yeah.

81
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,031
- Do you get seasick easily?
- Why?

82
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,473
- We'll cure that soon enough.
- After a couple years in the galleys.

83
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,636
Ha ha, very funny.

84
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,474
- What are you doing?
- We're opening a bakery here in Nazareth.

85
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,196
Would you like samples of
our new Nazareth buns? Free.

86
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,550
- They smell really good. Come here.
- No, the Romans don't pay that well.

87
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,470
- Yeah, let's give them to someone else.
- Hey, you. Come here with those buns.

88
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,798
They're confiscated.
They belong to the Roman Empire.

89
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,959
- Aren't you going to catch them first?
- What?

90
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,311
Come back! Come on!

91
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,434
- Josefine, Jesus.
- Hi, Oskar.

92
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,679
- How do we get this up?
- What's stronger than iron now?

93
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,192
- Oh, cool.
- You have many strange things up north.

94
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,071
Cover your eyes.
Now you're going to see miracles.

95
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,716
(cell phone rings)

96
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,395
— Hi, dad.
- Hi. Did you take all the buns?

97
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,559
- Wasn't I allowed to?
- Not all of them, right?

98
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,912
- I was supposed to bring them to school.
- I had a meeting with my publisher.

99
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,714
I was supposed to bring samples.

100
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,434
- Get me out of here.
- Bye bye, dad.

101
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,518
(phone buzzes)
I hope they tasted good.

102
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,269
Thanks, Josefine …. and Jesus.

103
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,314
What's that noise?
What's going on here, huh?

104
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,876
— Nothing.
- You just stay here, okay.

105
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,713
Freeing a rebel is considered
a great crime here in the Roman Empire.

106
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,674
We'll have a hard time looking away
from a couple of crucifixions here.

107
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,632
Run!

108
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,078
What is it? You can make fire!

109
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,431
Help! Save me!

110
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,315
I'll make sure not to
tell anyone anything.

111
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,318
Otherwise the sky will fall
down on your head.

112
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,757
- Are the Romans after you?
- We got rid of them.

113
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,157
- Bloody brilliant.
- Thanks. Well done.

114
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,473
- Thanks for the help.
- We all have to help each other, right?

115
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,955
— Right?
— Yeah.

116
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,312
Jesus of Nazareth.
It's pretty big to have met you.

117
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,479
I'm also glad to have
met you, Oskar, the boy from the North.

118
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,069
The boy from the North?

119
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,793
Are you then the girl from the North?

120
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,554
Oskar has a gift for you.
Give him the mobile phone.

121
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,594
You can just tell your parents,
you lost it.

122
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,438
Thanks for the help. Here.

123
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,279
- Thanks.
- There's not much battery left.

124
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,278
You just ask to
have it charged up.

125
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,670
Yep, now it's charged.

126
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,958
Jesus, you rascal.
Where have you been all day?

127
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,915
I've bought boards,
but lacked someone to carry them.

128
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,680
- Sorry, Josef.
— Josef?

129
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,871
And who is that slob then?

130
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,277
Uh, Josef, this is Oskar.
Oskar, this is Josef.

131
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,109
Hey in the shed.
Ha, you didn't know that one, did you?

132
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,720
- Are you Josef?
— Yes.

133
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,668
- Josef of Abraham's lineage?
— Yes.

134
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,829
Abraham, David, Uriah, Solomon
and all the way down to me.

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,230
Jesus.

136
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,670
(knock on the door)

137
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,838
- Open up in the name of the Roman Empire!
- What do we do?

138
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,996
We hide in here,

139
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,356
- What now?
- Hurry up.

140
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,074
- That was pretty wild.
- Yeah, I'm getting used to it.

141
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,078
Thorsen.
(motorcycle noise)

142
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,669
He's probably out riding.

143
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,270
What now then?

144
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,711
- I think it should stay between us.
- Good idea.

145
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,391
Apart from you being captured,
wasn't it pretty fantastic?

146
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,515
- I don't really know.
- You're just jealous.

147
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,872
- It's dangerous to change the past.
- That's too wild.

148
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,915
The girl from the North. The one who taught
Jesus to perform miracles.

149
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,557
I've heard about her since
I was little, and it's just you.

150
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,513
Can't you see it's dangerous?

151
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,154
— Not really dangerous.
- Grotesquely dangerous.

152
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,229
- Yeah, and you're boring.
- I should destroy that nativity play.

153
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,795
You wouldn't dare do that.

154
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,996
Come on now.

155
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,316
(doorbell)

156
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,036
Josefine and Oskar,
You can come out now.

157
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,750
Josefine and Oskar.

158
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,076
- Hi.
- Hi.

159
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,192
- How did those buns taste?
— Totally wild.

160
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,949
Since I didn't come
to the meeting at the publisher's,

161
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,280
- maybe you could help me
come up with a name for those buns?

162
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,635
We called them Nazareth buns.

163
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:11,234
Just like the ones Jesus' friends used
when they were to free the boy from the North.

164
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,829
— Yeah.
- It's very Christmassy too, right?

165
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,955
Then you could drink Nazareth juice with it.
That's a really good idea.

166
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,040
Dad, is it dangerous
to change the past?

167
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,074
Whether it's dangerous?
Well, I actually don't know.

168
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,238
There were plenty of things
I'd like to change.

169
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,149
- You just can't do that.
- But if you could.

170
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,957
Then you could prevent wars,
and people from being killed.

171
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,711
- Then everyone could wear elf hats.
- Of course it's dangerous.

172
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,435
- Elf hats aren't dangerous.
- Stop with the elf hat stuff.

173
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,596
How dangerous?

174
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,716
Even the smallest change in the past
can completely change people's lives.

175
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,150
How?

176
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,831
Once I biked over
a piece of glass, and my bike got a flat tire.

177
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,430
- By chance, a young guy came by.
- And that was Dad.

178
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,076
I know that story.
What's special about it?

179
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,478
If I hadn't run over the glass,
I wouldn't have met your dad.

180
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,037
And we wouldn't be sitting here.
You two would never have been born.

181
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,477
Dear God. Thanks because Oskar
was saved, and everything is okay.

182
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,992
I'll try not to change
too much in the past.

183
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,716
- At least not in a way that matters.
- Who wants a whack on the head?

184
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,595
That's you, if you don't
lie down and go to sleep now.

185
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,795
Because I don't want to miss
going down to Jesus. Amen.
