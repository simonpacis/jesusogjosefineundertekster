1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,189
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,709
- Okay.
- Your eyes behind the veil are …

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,959
In Nazareth, Maria is worried.
Is her son in love with Josefine?

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,630
You are so beautiful.
Your mouth is lovely.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,595
Jesus has fallen in love. The girl
from the North has turned his head.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,997
Louise asks
if Josefine will look after Lukas.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,953
- I have an appointment.
- Yeah, right.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,914
Josefine promises
and gets Oskar to look after him.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,193
- Hi, Oskar. See you, Lukas.
- No! Hey, you can't do that!

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,709
While she herself visits Jesus.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,473
Jesus says
that he is in love with her.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,591
- At that moment Oskar calls.
- I don't have time now.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,473
Lukas has disappeared.
Josefine has to go back.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,194
- Aren't you coming back then?
- Yes, yes.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,997
When they have found Lukas, Oskar wants
to hear more about her new friend, Jesus.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,156
Where does that Jesus live?

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,878
Josefine explains she has discovered a
time machine. Oskar doesn't believe her.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,719
- Yeah, let's say that.
- Yeah, let's say that.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,916
In her evening prayer, Josefine tells
that she has fallen in love with Jesus.

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,480
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,593
laid in the soil like flower seeds

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,033
shoots and sprouts and winds around

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,950
she understands nothing at all

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,948
hours feel like days

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,075
and weeks a thousand years

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,308
came to look back

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,274
to a world of yesterday

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,508
Jesus and Josefine

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,998
homeless heartache

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,320
but Jesus gets Josefine

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,910
to believe in miracles

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,078
when she wavers

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,831
Jesus and Josefine

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,511
faithless time machine

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,272
the tempter's concubine

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,793
she needs miracles
and love

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,549
when she wavers

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,196
Good morning.
You're up early, aren't you?

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,835
- What are you looking for?
- Something more about that girl from the North.

40
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,319
- You like her, huh?
- Did she and Jesus become sweethearts?

41
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,595
Now Jesus didn't have sweethearts,
but a rather unknown text suggests it.

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,237
- What kind of text is that?
- It's not one that's in the Bible.

43
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,399
It's an ancient folk tale
most consider nonsense.

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,195
- I think they became sweethearts.
- No.

45
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,595
- Why not?
- Because …

46
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,873
Jesus just didn't have any sweethearts,
I think.

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,353
- Are you talking about Jesus again?
- Yes, that's nice.

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,154
Not at this time of the morning, huh?

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,316
- Wanna fight?
- Yes.

50
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,391
Here you go, Herod.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,196
All male children under two years
in Bethlehem shall be captured and murdered, -

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,632
- so I can put an end to
this king of the Jews.

53
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,393
Yes, that's fine, Emilie, but I want
to feel a bit more malice.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,072
Imagine, you're king in a country,
you have soldiers under you, -

55
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,114
- you're under the Romans' protection, -

56
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,039
- and there's nothing
that can threaten you.

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,358
And yet you choose
to kill the little children.

58
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,870
Come on, try again.
A bit more malice in the voice.

59
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,993
Ready? Go ahead, Herod.

60
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,272
All male children in Bethlehem
shall be murdered. Ha ha.

61
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,392
He's at least not
a cuddly baby.

62
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,596
(doorbell)

63
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
(Thorsen panting and groaning)

64
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,236
Hi, Josefine.

65
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,950
What are you saying then, huh?

66
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,311
Is it so the motorcycle
can go faster?

67
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,752
No. It's so
it looks cooler.

68
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,239
What do you girls know about beauty? You think
it's sitting on a beachfront -

69
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,716
- and interlacing fingers with the one
you're in love with.

70
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,237
- I can see you're in love.
- How so?

71
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,955
That's girls your age.
But do you know what?

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,314
Falling in love, it's nothing but
a short circuit in the brain.

73
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,438
- What are you saying then?
- Yeah, that's fine, Thorsen.

74
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,074
Say hi to the pin-ups.

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,756
There.

76
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,837
(chimes)

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,956
Jesus.

78
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,636
Jesus.

79
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,349
- Hi, Josefine.
- Hey, Jesus.

80
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,269
- We're leaving right away.
- Where are we going?

81
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,075
- Pardos has come to Nazareth.
- Who's Pardos?

82
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,556
- That gladiator I told you about.
- Wait a minute.

83
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,876
- Can't we just talk?
- He might be gone by then. Come on.

84
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,916
(rattling chains)

85
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,876
Ah.

86
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,160
(whip crack and cry of pain)

87
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,556
Now watch this.

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,797
- Is Pardos coming down there?
- His stuff is still there.

89
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,991
I saw those Romans
crucify a man.

90
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,476
No, Jesus. Jesus, come. Jesus.

91
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,156
I can easily beat you. Take that.

92
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,551
Why did they crucify that man?

93
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,469
He rebelled.

94
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,074
Is anyone there?

95
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,034
So what? Are there more
who want to fight before I move on?

96
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,754
No thanks, Pardos.

97
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,520
- What? Are you sure?
- Yes.

98
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,636
Sissies.

99
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,799
There's no point in putting on
a show when no one dares to step up.

100
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
- I dare.
- Who are you?

101
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,675
I'm Jesus, and this is Josefine,

102
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,359
Hey, Jesus and Josefine.
I don't fight children, after all.

103
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,516
I'm not a child.

104
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,356
Jesus.

105
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,632
Come on. Come on. Don't you dare?

106
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,076
Then come on. Come on.

107
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,991
Come on.

108
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,436
Jesus.

109
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,313
Watch out, or you'll end up in chains.

110
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,277
- You have talent, boy.
- You think so?

111
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,316
Yes. The world is waiting for you. You'll be
the greatest. Everyone will know your name.

112
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,954
Whoa
Jesus, watch out.

113
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,229
Watch where you stand. Otherwise
your career will be short, Jesus.

114
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,470
You're actually pretty good.

115
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,916
(mobile phone rings)

116
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,436
(presses a button)

117
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,995
Hello?

118
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,272
Hello, Josefine?

119
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,711
Hello? What's happening?

120
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,833
- Is that the angel?
- The angel?

121
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,716
- Sorry, who am I speaking to?
- This is Josef.

122
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,233
- Josef of Nazareth.
- If you're Josef, then I'm …

123
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,874
- God.
- God?

124
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,116
Hey to you, Josef.

125
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,919
Sorry if I haven't behaved
properly, but I'm just a carpenter.

126
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,831
- You're good enough, Josef.
- Is that true? Am I good enough?

127
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,512
- Well, thank you very much.
- Who are you talking to?

128
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,679
Yes, it's the Lord.
He says I'm good enough.

129
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,156
Hello?
Hello? What's happening?

130
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,316
Get that away, Josef.

131
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,398
Josef, come. Josef.

132
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,273
(the sheep bleats, and the phone beeps)

133
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,232
- How does one become a gladiator?
- It's slaves who are forced.

134
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,434
- Listen. No one wants to become a gladiator.
- I do.

135
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,668
There's an opportunity for a talent.
In Caesarea there's a gladiator school.

136
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,998
- What is that? Can you come out then!
- Those are my friends.

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,239
Sorry, Pardos. But I don't want to see children from the village here.

138
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,353
- But we're talking.
- Come on.

139
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,269
- Can't I just come with you?
- Goodbye.

140
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,269
Nothing good has ever come
from Nazareth.

141
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,709
- I'm just saying, Pardos is okay.
- But you don't need to become a gladiator.

142
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,357
What is this?
You're really sent by Satan.

143
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,313
- It's Satan's work.
- It's my mobile.

144
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,877
I've said it before: Stay away
from my son. Satan's emissary.

145
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,791
- She prevented me from becoming a gladiator.
- Why would you become a gladiator?

146
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,309
- Because you're so tough.
- I'm watching out.

147
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,593
- Then he gets some dumb ideas.
- Gladiator is not a dumb idea.

148
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,076
That's not entirely wrong.
You're a bit tough.

149
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,670
Yeah, but am I that tough?

150
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,278
- Let's leave them alone for a bit.
- We can't leave them alone.

151
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,519
Come on, Maria.
Weren't you baking something?

152
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,197
- I have to go home too.
- I'll get your phone for you tomorrow.

153
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,469
(Maria clears her throat)

154
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,156
See you,

155
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,755
Hey, Josefine.

156
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,431
I called, and then I got hold of a guy,
who was named Josef.

157
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,632
He sounded like someone,
who had never spoken on a mobile.

158
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,071
- That was probably my dad.
- That wasn't his voice.

159
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,434
My dad is pretty good at disguising
his voice. Goodbye, Oskar.

160
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,750
(war cry)

161
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,157
- No, there's nothing about that.
- About what?

162
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,514
- About Jesus wanting to be a gladiator.
- No, there's probably nothing about that.

163
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,790
- Stop that.
- It's my calendar gift.

164
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,070
Come here.

165
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,275
You're sitting with that Bible all the time.
Didn't you want Christmas removed?

166
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,031
Yes. Jesus doesn't know anyway,
when he was born.

167
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,789
Jesus doesn't know.
Didn't know, you mean, right?

168
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,199
- He might never have existed.
- Yes, Jesper. He has.

169
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,916
- It could be a Robin Hood story.
- Didn't Robin Hood exist?

170
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,192
Josefine is allowed to
be interested in Jesus.

171
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,837
(phone rings)
There are limits, right?

172
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,190
It's Jesper.

173
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,674
Just a moment.

174
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,269
Josefine, it's Jesus.

175
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,393
- This is Josefine.
- I wanted to say, I have your phone.

176
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,230
- Then I'll come over tomorrow.
- Jesus, what are you doing?

177
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,477
- How do you turn it off?
- Press the red button.

178
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,553
It's not his fault,
his name is Jesus.

179
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,672
Dear God,
or whoever is out there.

180
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,952
Dad and mom think,
Jesus is an ordinary boy.

181
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,391
That's fine. Thanks for the help.

182
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,549
And now it's about time that Jesus
becomes boyfriend with the girl from the North.

183
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,719
- Are you boyfriend with the girl from the North?
- Go to sleep now, Lukas.

184
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,549
Jesus could well take
to become boyfriend with the girl from the North.
