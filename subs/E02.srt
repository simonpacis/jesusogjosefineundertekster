1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,038
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,313
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?
Okay …

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,875
It's unfair,
I have my birthday on Christmas Eve.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,278
12-year-old Josefine doesn't think it's
fun to have her birthday on Christmas Eve.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,792
Last year we sang
happy birthday around the Christmas tree.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,992
And the year before we had
a class party, and who came?

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,679
No one.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,316
If only she could find
a way to move Christmas.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,594
It's hard when Christmas is Jesus'
birthday, and your mom is a priest.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,236
It can also be cool to have
your birthday the same day as Jesus.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,119
That doesn't make it easier
that they have to rehearse a nativity play, -

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,313
- and Josefine is forced to
play the Virgin Mary.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,592
Her best friend,
classmate Oskar, -

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,756
- has a shed in his backyard.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,317
Here he has a cage with
small degus from South America.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,590
Hi, Oskar.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,590
One of the degus is named Stella,
and she can give birth any time.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,835
In the evening, Stella disappears.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,191
You have to help me. Stella is gone.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,039
Josefine helps with the search.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,708
But a mysterious man
beats them to it.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,636
Is it these you're looking for?

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,556
Hi.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,036
What was that mysterious guy
doing in front of the stable, -

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,869
- where the baby Jesus was born
2,000 years ago?

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,679
on her pillow thoughts queue up

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,714
planted in the ground like flower seeds

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,278
shoots and sprouts and winds around

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,031
she understands nothing at all

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,028
hours feel like days

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,710
and weeks a thousand years

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,548
came to look back

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,548
to a world of yesterday

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,390
Jesus and Josefine

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,151
homeless heartache

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,593
but Jesus gets Josefine

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,156
to believe in miracles

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,158
when she wavers

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,070
Jesus and Josefine

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,796
faithless time machine

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,551
the tempter's concubine

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,553
she needs miracles

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,469
when she wavers

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,638
(knock on the door)

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,470
Your Royal Highness Herod.
Three wise men from the East.

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,348
Your High Excellency,
where is the newborn king of the Jews?

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,633
We have seen his star rise,
and we have come to worship him.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,992
But now we are lost,
so we come to you.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,839
We bring gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,192
- We want to kneel at the new king's feet.
- Well, then kneel.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,029
- He's right here.
- Sorry?

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,034
Yes, he's certainly not a newborn.

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,879
But he will be the new king
when I die.

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,117
His name is Herod, just like mine.

55
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,719
(clinking)

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,513
Joshua, our high priest.

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,439
Step closer. Yes, he is blind.

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,394
But he sees more than most.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,910
It is written
in the old scriptures, -

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,511
- that a ruler shall be born in Bethlehem.

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,473
And he will shepherd Israel's people.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,074
A ruler shall be born in Bethlehem,
you say?

63
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,230
And it's not my son?

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,871
That must be the answer to your question.
Go to Bethlehem, my lords.

65
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,356
Find the new king, and …

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,758
… when you have found him,
come back to me, -

67
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,397
- so that I may worship him
with you.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,989
(laughs maliciously)

69
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,157
You have such small, fine hands.

70
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,194
These are real king's hands.

71
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,675
They are not king's hands, Maria.
These are a good set of carpenter's hands.

72
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,838
- Is that the king?
- I'm a carpenter.

73
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,634
May we see?

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,715
Peace, little king.

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,948
- Such small hands he has.
- Real king's hands.

76
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,071
Peace be with you.

77
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,317
Yes, sorry.
We forget to introduce ourselves.

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,072
I am Caspar. Melchior. And Balthazar.

79
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,350
We have brought gifts.

80
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,190
"Oh, wise men. I thank you
for giving my child gifts."

81
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,914
"Oh God …"

82
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,116
"I thank God because He let you see
the great star in the heavens."

83
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,676
I think you'll be
a super good Virgin Mary.

84
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,668
I think it sounds completely right
when you say it.

85
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,519
I don't think
Virgin Mary spoke like that.

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,554
Do you perhaps know
how she spoke 2,000 years ago?

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,389
I think Josefine is right.
No one knows how people talked.

88
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,797
- Then I'll just rewrite it.
- We don't know much about them.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,152
Except that it's believed
Jesus was born in the summer.

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,920
In the summer?

91
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,192
- Jesper, watch your cookbook.
- I am too.

92
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,154
There are some Christmas pretzels here
that you should taste.

93
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,954
They should be the second recipe in:

94
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,472
"Jesper's Cookbook.
24 really simple Christmas recipes."

95
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,716
Should there only be 24 recipes in it?

96
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,914
Yes, then there should be some pictures
and something about the history of bread.

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,429
You can also settle for four recipes.

98
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,519
Then there's a greater chance
that you'll finish it.

99
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,870
If Jesus was born in the summer, -

100
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,117
- why do people celebrate him
on my birthday?

101
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,073
That was something the church decided,
right, Louise?

102
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,636
- Jesus was born on Christmas Eve.
- That's actually right.

103
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,719
Jesus was born on Christmas Eve,
and you can't change that.

104
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,117
I believe in Jesus and in Santa Claus.

105
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,311
- Cut it out.
- That's my calendar gift.

106
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,715
So, you two. Pine needles in your hair.

107
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,831
Who should I write to?

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,998
I'd try the Ministry of Church Affairs.

109
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,591
So I'll write and ask to have
Christmas moved to Midsummer.

110
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,955
Yeah, here you go.

111
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,872
My prince, we bring you gifts.
Gold, frankincense and myrrh pure.

112
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,278
Phew, it's hot here. Probably because
it's the middle of summer.

113
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,994
That doesn't say so in the script.

114
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,794
Jesus was thus born
in the middle of summer.

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,197
— Jesus was born on Christmas Eve.
- Don't I have it right, Jytte?

116
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,118
No. We'll take it again.

117
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,912
I thank you for wanting to be in
our humble stable here in Bethlehem.

118
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,035
What do you say to watching Jesus
while we party it up in Jerusalem?

119
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,833
- Try to see what it says there.
- "Christmas-free zone"?

120
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,753
That must be just the thing for me. Come on.

121
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,674
(doorbell rings)

122
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,114
Can you see who it is?

123
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,110
It's that mysterious guy from yesterday.

124
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,988
- Hi, mysterious from yesterday.
- Hello. My name is now Thorsen.

125
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,998
Oh, is that you?

126
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,112
How are the goats doing?

127
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,279
- They're doing fine, right, Oskar?
- Yes, they're doing well.

128
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,191
— We just wanted to say thanks for the help.
- No problem. I was just passing by.

129
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,190
- May we look around a bit?
- Yes yes, anything you like.

130
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,199
Josefine, I do have
an appointment with my mom.

131
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,995
No, we can definitely find
a lot for the nativity play.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,310
- I'm going home now.
- Okay.

133
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,671
- See you,
- See you, Oskar.

134
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,831
Bye bye.

135
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,234
- Does all this cost only one krone?
- Yes, well …

136
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,115
- Is there something special you're looking for?
- No, I'm just looking.

137
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,271
Why is it a Christmas-free zone?

138
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,713
Yeah, that … I don't care
much about Christmas.

139
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,513
- Does it bother you?
- No, I think it's cool.

140
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,677
Why's that, if I may ask?

141
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,034
Because I have my birthday on Christmas Eve,
and it's really annoying.

142
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,549
You have to put up with a lot, huh?

143
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,433
Sometimes even too much.

144
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,790
Yeah,

145
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,953
- It was nice to meet you.
- Likewise, Josefine.

146
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,720
- You're always welcome.
- Thanks.

147
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,750
- Is "Ministry of Church Affairs" spelled with a capital?
- Hold on a little break.

148
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,678
We're going to eat now.

149
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,473
- Why do we have to have rice pudding?
- I promised Lukas.

150
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,955
— I'm a gnome.
- When you were little, you loved it.

151
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,836
- Sorry, I've gotten big.
- But I do like rice pudding.

152
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,352
- It looks really delicious.
- I've kept it simple.

153
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,792
Can't I have something else to drink?
Maybe apple juice.

154
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,992
You can only drink elf beer
with rice pudding.

155
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,510
- You don't decide that.
- That's quite right.

156
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,472
There you hear it yourself.

157
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,277
Oh hell!

158
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,358
- He didn't do it on purpose.
- Yes, he did.

159
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,357
Josefine!

160
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,154
If you're really quick,
you can make it down and buy a new spoon.

161
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,709
(doorbell rings)

162
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,072
Hello?

163
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,032
Can I buy a pot ladle for a krone?

164
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,193
Hello? Is anyone here?

165
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,913
(cat meows in the distance)

166
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,994
(chimes start)

167
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,034
(doorbell rings)

168
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,111
Well?

169
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,308
- What can I do for you?
- You don't have an old pot ladle?

170
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,230
An old pot ladle?
That's not what I sell the most of.

171
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,070
I wonder if there might be
a couple left?

172
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,510
Are you going to make porridge?

173
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,430
Should it be very worn
or only a little worn?

174
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,269
- The price is the same.
- I think it should be very worn.

175
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,948
This one? Is it worn enough?

176
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,435
Yes, thanks.

177
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,392
Why is it actually
that you don't like Christmas?

178
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,239
You'd like to know?

179
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,399
Good. To make
a long story very short…

180
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,279
This boy could well be me.

181
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,711
I've stood alone in the snow on Christmas Eve,-

182
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,833
- because I'd said
something naughty to my dad.

183
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,554
He threw me out.

184
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,996
And there I stood. Completely alone.

185
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,910
I had to wrap old newspapers around my legs
and sleep in a cold stairwell.

186
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,756
Yeah….

187
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,479
Since then I've refused
to celebrate Christmas.

188
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,151
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Bye.

189
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,078
Bye.

190
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,232
Here you go. And sorry.

191
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,388
You took quite a while.

192
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,672
- How's the letter coming?
- I'm almost done.

193
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,519
- Can't we hear a bit?
- Yes.

194
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,510
"Dear Church Ministry.
We are quite a few,-

195
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,918
- who think it's strange
that Christmas Eve is December 24th,-

196
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,635
- when it's proven that Jesus
was born in the summer."

197
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,389
Therefore I suggest
we move Christmas Eve to Midsummer,-

198
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,716
- and it can happen pretty quickly."

199
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,434
Best regards, Josefine,"

200
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,155
- That's a stupid letter.
- Yeah yeah, eat your rice pudding.

201
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,835
Dear God, or whoever is out there.

202
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,350
I wouldn't mind,
if there were Christmas-free zones everywhere.

203
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,075
- What kind of Lone?
- Lukas, good night.

204
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,156
(door creaks)
