1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,394
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,353
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,076
Okay.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,398
Josefine is back in the present.
The world has become normal again.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,751
Dad, the Advent candle
has only burned down to the 18th.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,555
We've apparently been so busy,
that we've forgotten to light it.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,673
In the family, Jesper and Louise
are behind with all the Christmas preparations.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,270
Josefine, we're going to have to
talk about your birthday.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,756
- What's wrong with it?
- We can't manage to arrange it.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,954
Josefine meets with Oskar.
She wants to say that she's in love.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,835
Do you remember when you asked,
if we should be boyfriend and girlfriend?

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,677
— I was thinking that …
- I'm glad we're just friends.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,953
In the church, Jytte thinks
that they should rehearse the final scene alone.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,276
Suddenly Thorsen appears.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,677
No!

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,279
We must trust in God.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,314
They succeed in chasing Thorsen away
by trusting in God -

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,590
- and praying the Lord's Prayer.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,676
Do you remember what you promised yesterday?

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,668
Oskar asks if she has
ruined the nativity play.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,155
Josefine says that she has.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,669
Even though it's not true.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,351
In her evening prayer, Josefine says,
that she wants to be friends with Oskar.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,154
But most of all she wants to be girlfriend,

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,195
If we can't be boyfriend and girlfriend,
it's okay that we're friends. Amen.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,112
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,790
laid in the soil like flower seeds

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,279
shoots and sprouts and winds around

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,076
she understands nothing at all

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,989
hours feel like days

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,397
and weeks a thousand years

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,433
came to look back

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,469
to a world of yesterday

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,754
Jesus and Josefine

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,112
homeless heartache

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,633
but Jesus gets Josefine

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,469
to believe in miracles

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,194
when she wavers

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,110
Jesus and Josefine

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,836
faithless time machine

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,637
the tempter's concubine

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,832
she needs miracles

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,753
when she wavers

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,469
Today is Josefine's birthday,
hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,231
She surely gets a gift,
that she has wished for this year.

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,558
With delicious chocolate and cakes too.

47
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,716
Happy birthday, sweetie.

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,070
— Here, it's for you.
— Thanks.

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,271
You can't guess what it is.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,150
- No, it's an elf hat.
- I told you so.

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,316
- Is that how it's supposed to sit?
— Yes.

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,637
And do you know what the best
thing about your birthday is?

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,751
It's that it's Christmas Eve.

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,155
(laughs)

55
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,999
Happy birthday, sweetie.

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,158
12 years old. I must say.

57
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,513
Do you know what's the best
about your birthday?

58
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,792
It's that it's your birthday.
A little pre-gift.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,991
You'll get the rest later.

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,954
I hope you like it.

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,116
Wow, it's so cool.

62
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,870
— Happy birthday, sweet darling.
- Thanks, dad.

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,352
How nice it is.

64
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,269
You have to excuse me.
I'm completely Christmas-stressed.

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,348
- But I made these myself,
- Then I'll take the biggest one.

66
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,757
On my birthday
I want the biggest one.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,955
Chocolate ball?

68
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,390
Oh, sorry. Yes, thanks.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,592
I'm sitting thinking about
my Christmas sermon.

70
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,756
I don't think it's good enough.

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,394
Yes yes, it'll be fine.

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,594
- Mom, is something wrong with you?
- No, of course not.

73
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,393
I just don't know
what to say in church.

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,989
What I have is completely miserable.

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,399
Actually, I'd like to
talk to Jesus. Your friend Jesus.

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,230
Last time he said something
that I could really use.

77
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,637
I just think he'd say,
you should trust in God.

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,511
Trust in God? Yeah.

79
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,918
No, I don't think
that's enough for a whole Christmas sermon.

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,156
I don't think so.

81
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,631
Okay, I have to go to Oskar.
See you in church.

82
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,391
And don't be late.
You're in the Nativity play.

83
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,590
Hi, Oskar.

84
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
- Hi, Emilie.
- Hi, Josefine.

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,398
See you in church, Oskar.

86
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,634
- Should Emilie play Mary instead?
- Me and Emilie are just good friends.

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,638
- Just like us two.
- That's what we'll say.

88
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,837
— Happy birthday.
— Thanks.

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,639
I haven't bought a gift for you.
The last days have been quite busy.

90
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,113
That's okay. That the world became normal,
is the best birthday gift.

91
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,595
Do you have your role down?

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,553
- I hope so.
- Come on.

93
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,116
(church bells ring)

94
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,709
So, now you just watch, Jesus.

95
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,673
You hold here,
and then you hold the board.

96
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,519
No, not there,
you'll saw your finger.

97
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,599
- Has he cut himself?
- No no, I'm watching him.

98
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,112
- If he gets even a little cut …
- No, calm down. I … Ouch!

99
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,709
See what happened now.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,028
- You come yelling and screaming too.
- Let me see where you cut yourself.

101
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,196
There is no wound.

102
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,759
Jesus, that's a miracle.

103
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,271
Rise up, Joseph of Abraham's lineage.

104
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,916
Take the child and its mother with you
back to the land of Israel.

105
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,910
For the one who wanted to …

106
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,114
For the one who killed the child,
is himself dead.

107
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,590
The light …

108
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,035
- King Herod is dead.
- Is that true?

109
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,153
We're going home, Mary. Home to Nazareth.

110
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,519
(applause)

111
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,628
I have to be honest and say, -

112
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,191
- that I haven't prepared
any Christmas sermon.

113
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,517
(people murmur)

114
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,632
I don't know
if there are others who feel, -

115
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,799
- like some days
have disappeared.

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,276
As if time has flown by.

117
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,550
Strange.

118
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,559
My daughter said I should give
a sermon about trusting God.

119
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,593
I said it was too little.

120
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,029
And what does that have to do
with Jesus' birth and Christmas?

121
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,717
So stupidly I answered this morning.

122
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,231
Because in reality, that's probably what
it's all about.

123
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,193
We must trust in God.

124
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,870
Even if it doesn't always feel
like he's here with us.

125
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,196
Things happen as they happen.

126
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,392
I'm unprepared,
and you really must excuse that.

127
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,592
But I can't
move Christmas to tomorrow.

128
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,669
And I'm damn well forced to
stand here and look you all in the eyes, -

129
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,599
- because I chose it myself.

130
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,591
But there's one thing that helps me.

131
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,713
And that's that I trust in God.

132
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,036
Just like Mary had to trust in God, -

133
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,119
- when an angel came and said
that she would give birth to God's son.

134
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,793
And Joseph had to, when he was to
take care of a child that wasn't his.

135
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,753
And as Jesus had to trust in God
when he discovered, -

136
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,191
- that his task here on earth
was inhumanly hard.

137
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,475
We celebrate Christmas, -

138
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,236
- because God's son was born
here on earth as a human.

139
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,155
Can we trust that?

140
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,196
If we believe it, then it's true.

141
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,115
And if we don't believe it, -

142
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,196
- it might still be true.

143
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,516
(church organ plays)

144
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,036
Merry Christmas.

145
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,072
Yes, I just want to say
that it was a very beautiful sermon.

146
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,239
- Thank you very much.
- I'm looking forward to coming again.

147
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,870
- Have you seen Oskar?
- He was standing right over there earlier.

148
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,830
- Have you seen Oskar?
- No, I think he's gone home.

149
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,075
Is that him?

150
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,796
- Is there something you want to say to him?
- No.

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,992
- Well, but Merry Christmas.
- Happy birthday.

152
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,153
- Merry Christmas, everyone.
— Thanks.

153
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,349
- Did you find Oskar?
- No.

154
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,389
- Won't you see him over Christmas break?
- Yeah, but it's just not the same.

155
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,716
I thought he would wait for me.

156
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,914
Remember, Josefine:
Love is patient.

157
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,032
Can you have a Merry Christmas
and a really happy birthday?

158
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,231
Thanks, same to you.

159
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,194
There you are. Aren't you coming home?

160
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,118
Yes,

161
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,672
You can't hang
all the elves on the same branch.

162
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,396
- Yes, so they can talk together.
- Then I'll hang the Christmas hearts here.

163
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,195
Then I can
put all the baubles right here.

164
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,437
Then the elves can talk to these.

165
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,835
How lovely they are.

166
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,269
How beautiful it is.

167
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,792
Now we're just missing one thing.

168
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,515
- And that's the gifts under the tree.
- The gifts!

169
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,513
— Yes, the gifts.
- I'd forgotten.

170
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,436
(sighs)

171
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,676
The gifts from Jesus.

172
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,239
- Are you okay?
- I'm wrapping gifts.

173
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,439
- Out, dad.
- Yes, of course.

174
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,313
A poor virgin sat in the barn.

175
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,195
Sat in the barn.

176
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,757
And bore Heaven's king son.

177
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,316
Hallelujah.

178
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,080
Hallelujah.

179
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,430
- We'll take them all together again.
- Next year, Lukas.

180
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,517
Now we're getting gifts.

181
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,389
This one's for you, Lukas.

182
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,559
This one's for you, mom.

183
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,832
And this one's for you, dad.

184
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,951
Oh, thanks.

185
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,554
- Look at this. A Kalaha game.
- How beautiful.

186
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,354
It's handmade.
Who made it?

187
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,676
Jesus, of course.

188
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,436
What is this now?

189
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,313
- No.
- How beautiful it is.

190
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,832
Uhm, how good it smells.
A thousand thanks.

191
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,270
It's a healing oil.

192
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,190
No, how beautiful it is.

193
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,678
I'm really happy with this one.
Thank you very much.

194
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,554
There are also some
who have a gift for you.

195
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,676
Today is Josefine's birthday,
hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray.

196
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,431
She surely gets a gift she wants,
that she's wished for this year, -

197
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,031
- with lovely chocolate and cakes too.

198
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,437
Long live Josefine:
Hip hip hooray!

199
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,788
Here you go. Happy birthday.
It's from all of us.

200
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,791
(murmuring)

201
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,116
That's Josefine right there.

202
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,955
- A thousand thanks.
- It was nothing.

203
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,277
(chimes)
I just need to fetch something.

204
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,590
- Jesus?
- Happy birthday.

205
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,552
Same to you.

206
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,878
And I think
you should give that to your dad.

207
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,913
He'll be really happy for it.

208
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,671
- It worked.
- What?

209
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,269
- Trusting in God.
- Of course.

210
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,550
Josefine?

211
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,115
- I'd better get going.
- It was nice seeing you.

212
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,997
I've figured out
how to close the time portal.

213
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,555
You just have to put it in the manger,
when I've left.

214
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,518
(chimes start)

215
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,393
Josefine, I'll never forget you.

216
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,750
Same to you.

217
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,711
- You have the house full of guests.
- I just had to find this one.

218
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,238
That's ...

219
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,877
- How ...
- It's a secret.

220
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,949
That's fantastic.
That's a miracle. Louise.

221
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,711
Just come in.

222
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,518
You promised to destroy the manger game.

223
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,076
It doesn't work anymore.

224
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,318
- There's something I want to ask you.
— Yes.

225
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,790
Maybe you'd like, you know,
to go out together or …

226
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,029
What about Emilie then?

227
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,232
She's been helping
to arrange all this.

228
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,396
She's the best friend.

229
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,276
But if you don't want to be boyfriend and girlfriend,
we can just be friends.

230
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,755
Josefine, sorry. Aren't you coming?
There's chips and soda.

231
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,076
We're coming now. Pine needles in the hair.

232
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,953
Josefine. Now it's party time.

233
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,079
Here ends our adventure
about Jesus and Josefine.

234
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,955
Josefine learned that there is something
more important than one's birthday.

235
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,915
Jesus learned that he is God's son,
and that great tasks await him.

236
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,188
Oskar got a girlfriend
and Jesper a cookbook.

237
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,870
Louise filled the church,
and Lukas got a Kalaha game.

238
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,550
We wish everyone
a merry and blessed Christmas -

239
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,433
- with lots of pine needles in the hair.

240
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,077
Jesus and Josefine

241
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,751
homeless heartache

242
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,033
but Jesus gets Josefine

243
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,519
to believe in miracles

244
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,316
Jesus and Josefine

245
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,036
faithless time machine

246
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,633
tempter's concubine

247
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,912
she needs miracles

248
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,273
when she wavers

249
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,399
