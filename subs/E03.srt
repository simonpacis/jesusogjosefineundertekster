1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,235
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,193
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,440
12-year-old Josefine doesn't think it's
fun to have her birthday on Christmas Eve.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,349
If only she could find
a way to move Christmas.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,756
But it's hard when Christmas is Jesus'
birthday, and your mom is a priest.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,149
Is "Kirkeministeriet" spelled with a capital?

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,114
Josefine and Oskar have found out that
the mysterious man has a shop.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,313
- Hi, mysterious from yesterday.
- Hello. My name is now Thorsen.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,239
Thorsen doesn't like Christmas either.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,908
- Does that bother you?
- No, that's cool.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,874
Josefine goes exploring
in Thorsen's shop.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,032
Maybe it holds
an exciting secret.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,992
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,715
laid in the ground like flower seeds

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,948
shoots and sprouts and winds around

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,756
she understands nothing at all

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,839
hours feel like days

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,430
and weeks a thousand years

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,433
came to look back

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,394
to a world of yesterday

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,037
Jesus and Josefine

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,870
homeless heartache

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,438
but Jesus makes Josefine

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,916
believe in miracles

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,078
when she wavers

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,876
Jesus and Josefine

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,676
faithless time machine

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,829
tempter's concubine

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,353
she needs miracles

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,270
when she wavers

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,718
(Maria hums softly)

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,555
(heavy boot steps)

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,639
Any news about the child in Bethlehem?

34
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,958
The three wise men found what they sought,
and took another way home.

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,715
We don't know where the child is.

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,428
So it's true.

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,915
The Savior is born.

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,112
He who shall be king over us all,

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,072
King over us all?!

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,876
Never.

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,674
I hereby command:

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,954
All male children under two years
in Bethlehem shall be killed.

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,599
The Savior must not die.
What about the innocent children?

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,677
Begone.

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,077
You are no longer my high priest.

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,512
But the children!
The innocent children. The children!

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,032
Get on with it.

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,555
(sheep bleat)

49
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,756
This stable could become
a fantastic carpenter's workshop.

50
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,431
The owner wants to sell. We just need
the gold from the wise men.

51
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,474
Joseph, my son shall not grow up
in a stable in Bethlehem.

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,716
That is also My son.

53
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,075
(door creaks)

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,476
Rise, Joseph of Nazareth.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,151
Take the child and its mother
and flee to Egypt.

56
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,194
— Stay there until I tell you.
- To Egypt?

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,030
King Herod has sent out riders.
He wants to kill the child.

58
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,430
Kill Jesus? But why?

59
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,388
- We must leave immediately.
- What about my carpenter's workshop?

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,479
- Then I'll go alone.
- No, Mary. I understand.

61
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,716
We're leaving right away.

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,995
- What now?
- I want to take the manger with us.

63
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,875
- Not when we're fleeing.
- It's a reminder of Jesus' birth.

64
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,958
It shall stay with me,
as long as I live.

65
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,552
(sighs)

66
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,835
"Oh, my beautiful wife.
We are traveling to the land of Egypt."

67
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,077
"What joy
that the angels came and warned us."

68
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,317
"One can always trust God in Heaven."

69
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,548
How beautiful. I'm touched.
You really fit well together.

70
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,756
- Don't you think it's nonsense?
- What do you mean?

71
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,679
That the virgin Mary had a child with God.

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,997
The Bible says that Mary
became pregnant with the Holy Spirit, -

73
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,270
- and the Holy Spirit is part of God.

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,395
Don't you think Mary fooled around
with some other guy besides Joseph?

75
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,034
I don't think so.
I'm a priest, after all.

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,998
- But you're a modern priest.
- What do you mean by "modern"?

77
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,709
One who doesn't believe everything in the Bible.

78
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,230
I believe everything
that one can learn from the Bible.

79
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,750
What actually happened
doesn't interest me.

80
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,431
- But of course I believe.
- I believe in the Holy Spirit.

81
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,189
- I believe in Santa Claus.
- And sweet treats and spruce in the hair.

82
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,439
Spelt bun? There's honey in it,
and then there are birches around.

83
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,472
What do you think?

84
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,831
- They taste pretty good.
- I'm making a cookbook.

85
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,158
It will be called "Jesper's Cookbook".
This will be recipe number three.

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,796
- Don't you think it'll be a hit?
- That's not my dad. Let's go.

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,796
And then King Herod ordered, -

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,834
— that all boys
under two years old should be killed.

89
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,589
How could Herod do something
so evil?

90
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,078
I think that Herod
was maybe jealous of Jesus.

91
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,877
And when one is jealous, the Devil
can make one do the strangest things.

92
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,275
Just like Josefine.

93
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,070
Jytte, if you're going to be completely honest,
do you think Jesus was God's son?

94
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,635
Yes, of course Jesus was God's son.

95
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,035
How do you know?

96
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,917
Because once
I was visited by an angel, -

97
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,635
- who told me
that it all is true.

98
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,592
Yeah, okay.

99
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,950
(bell rings)

100
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,675
Before you go, let's find out, -

101
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,589
- who provides
the props and costumes.

102
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,114
We need both some shepherd's staffs
and some carpenter's tools for Joseph.

103
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,670
And robes. Is there anyone
who's good at sewing?

104
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,634
I actually think
I can get it all.

105
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,116
- We know a shop.
- We're not going back there.

106
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,880
Yes, and you have to help carry.

107
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,640
(doorbell rings)

108
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,832
Hey, Josefine and Oskar. Hi.

109
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,874
We need props for
our nativity play. Can we look around?

110
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,640
Yes, yes. Anything you feel like.

111
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,115
It's desire that drives the work.

112
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,313
And I most feel like sitting
and cozying up with this book.

113
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,590
- It's creepy here.
- You can be scary yourself.

114
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,109
Try looking around.

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,354
Try seeing those there.

116
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,437
Shepherd's staffs.

117
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,990
"Oh, see the big star.
It shines so brightly."

118
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,836
Try seeing this one.

119
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,596
Joseph can use that
when he works in his workshop.

120
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,360
Try seeing here. Here are some robes.

121
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,439
Oskar, I want to show you
something totally wild. Come on.

122
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,392
Where is Jesus?

123
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,277
What do you say then?

124
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,675
Josefine,

125
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,231
There's something I've been thinking about.

126
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,277
Us two.

127
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,279
- Looks good.
- Are you finding anything you can use?

128
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,559
I didn't know
you liked Christmas stuff.

129
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,390
Just that nativity play
I refuse to throw out.

130
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,435
It's not for sale either.
Look here, I just found this one.

131
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,711
Wasn't that something
your Herod could use?

132
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,273
I think Emilie will love that one.

133
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,916
Thorsen, if you're going to be
completely honest, -

134
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,714
- do you think Jesus is God's son?

135
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,434
Yes, maybe.

136
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,632
But isn't it irrelevant?

137
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,960
- Why is it irrelevant?
- Aren't we all gods?

138
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,799
We're humans, not gods.

139
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,517
If we were all gods,
what's the fun in that?

140
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,996
Yeah, the fun is
that then we're invincible.

141
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,274
And have the right to do whatever we want.

142
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,712
Stella? Come on, Stella.

143
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,597
What about you, Stella? Are you a god too?

144
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,793
I think that thing about
us all being gods is nonsense.

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,797
I think it sounds cool.

146
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,474
Do you want something to eat, Stella?

147
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,188
Josefine, there's something
I want to ask you.

148
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,072
I'm going home now.

149
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,874
It's important,
and you need to sit down.

150
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,675
- Josefine?
- Yes, Oskar?

151
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,990
You promise to come over and help
carry this to school tomorrow.

152
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,318
There's also something else,
I want to ask you about.

153
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,511
Do you want to …

154
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,517
- I said it should go quickly.
- Josefine, wait a bit.

155
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,637
Would you like to get together?

156
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,794
Oskar, we are friends, after all.

157
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,436
Being boyfriend and girlfriend is also
a kind of being friends.

158
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,712
I'd like to think about it a bit.

159
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,270
Is there a whole kilo of pepper in it?

160
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,553
- No, just a teaspoonful.
- Aw.

161
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,718
- Spruce in the hair.
- What does that mean?

162
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,435
It means you have to put
some spruce in your hair, -

163
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,552
- then you get in the Christmas mood.
Like this.

164
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,396
What are you thinking about?

165
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,591
Nothing.

166
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,390
- I can tell you're thinking about something.
- It's private.

167
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,717
- Is it something with Oskar?
- No, why do you think that?

168
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,196
- I don't know.
- What are you writing?

169
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,359
It's not very private.
I'm writing my sermon.

170
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,192
Can't you just write that we
don't know if Jesus was God's son?

171
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,191
People would probably be disappointed.
Besides, it's not true.

172
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,837
Do you dare sign under
that Jesus was God's son?

173
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,672
I can sign it,
but deep down I don't really know.

174
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,792
- So you're standing there lying in church?
- No.

175
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,309
I can stand by what Jesus says.

176
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,719
That we should be kind to each other
and accept that we're different.

177
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,110
Doesn't it smell burnt here?

178
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,954
No no no.

179
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,678
- Shall we play Kalaha?
- In a bit.

180
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,348
(Josefine types away)

181
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,276
- I have just as many as you.
- Not anymore.

182
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,989
Then I get to take all yours.

183
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,990
- You didn't know that one.
— Bullshit.

184
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,873
We can play again tomorrow.

185
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,029
Josefine?

186
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,271
- What have you written in my sermon?
- What do you mean?

187
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,879
"But that Jesus was God's son,
I don't believe, -

188
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,514
- and aren't we all gods?"

189
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,554
And then you suggest
that Christmas should be moved to Midsummer.

190
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,356
I can't stand in church
on Sunday and say something like that.

191
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,917
- Why not?
- Because it's nonsense.

192
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,031
And if I did say it,
I'd get fired.

193
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,029
Oh
ah

194
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,437
- Goodnight, kids.
- Goodnight, mom.

195
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,076
Dear God,
or should I say co-god?

196
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,034
If you're up there somewhere,
won't you make it so that, -

197
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,993
- Oskar doesn't get too sad?

198
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,829
Because tomorrow I have to tell him,
that I don't want to be girlfriend.

199
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,556
Are you the worst?

200
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,833
No, that's you, if you don't
lie down and sleep now.

201
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,391
Amen.

202
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,114
