1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,318
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,793
- Jesus has traveled 2000 years into the future.
- Not on the stove!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,514
- He lives with Josefine.
- Use a pan.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,475
- My mom puts it on the stone oven.
- Jesper is worried about Jesus.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,831
He's sweet, but not well.
He needs help.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,031
The manger doesn't work.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,074
Your father wants you back,
but the manger is gone.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,555
Jesus can't come home.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,959
Jesus calls Nazareth and gets Simon
and Judas to look for the manger.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,711
They discover that Joseph sold the wood
from the manger to the Romans.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,071
I got scolded
for working on the Sabbath.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,909
I had to hide,
I used wood from my son's manger.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,351
Jesus orders them to
recreate the manger.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,189
- But it's dangerous.
- Say, it's an order from God.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,676
Jesus says,
it's a direct order from God.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,031
- It succeeds …
- Are you the Jesus?

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,836
But before Jesus can leave,
he is picked up by two policemen.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,669
- You can't do that.
- It's okay, Josefine.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,318
When Josefine comes home, Jesper says
he reported Jesus to the police.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,432
It was me,
who told them about Jesus.

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,279
You've just ruined everything,

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,834
on her pillow thoughts line up

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,999
laid in the soil like flower seeds

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,433
shoots and sprouts and winds around

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,111
she understands nothing at all

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,312
hours feel like days

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,836
and weeks a thousand years

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,717
came to look back

29
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,031
to a world of yesterday

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,557
Jesus and Josefine

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,470
homeless heartache

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,038
Jesus makes Josefine

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,312
believe in miracles

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,511
when she wavers

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,590
Jesus and Josefine

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,237
faithless time machine

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,309
the tempter's concubine

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,356
she needs miracles
and love

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,949
when she wavers

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,878
- Have you found out where Jesus is?
- I'm on hold. They find the log.

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,077
A kringle?

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,193
Why did you ask the police
to go after him?

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,155
- He thinks he's Jesus.
- That's why he shouldn't be abducted.

44
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,909
He hasn't been abducted.
You're completely blinded by him.

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,714
As if you were brainwashed.

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,549
Maybe you're in love.
Love makes you blind.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,513
Wait, now he's there.
Hello? Yes.

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,029
Okay. Yes, that's clear.

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,394
Should I just call tonight then?
I will. Thanks a thousand. Bye.

50
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,999
Now listen here.
Jesus stayed overnight at Solhuset.

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,672
It's a residential institution for young people
who are having a hard time.

52
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,873
That's where he'll stay,
until they find his family.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,631
- How long will it take?
- Until they find out something more.

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,479
They were right.
She's completely crazy about him.

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,035
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,556
Pine needles in your hair, right?
Have a pretzel.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,076
- We just need to get him out of Solhuset.
- The hardest part will be getting in.

58
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,999
We'll have to smuggle him out.

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,478
We don't need to smugle him out.

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,116
- Why not?
- Once we're in, we'll get him out.

61
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,189
I have a plan. We'll go down to
Thorsen first and then find Solhuset.

62
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,835
Hi, Oskar and Josefine.
I was just thinking about you.

63
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,113
I want to expand the shop
and need employees.

64
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,316
- How will you make room for that?
- There's plenty of space behind the door.

65
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,435
- What about getting more customers first?
- After the expansion, they'll come flocking.

66
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,634
They can't compete with my good offers.
Don't you want to be part of it?

67
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,594
- We go to school.
- Oh. What are you doing here then?

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,588
- The phone rang.
- Can we borrow your nativity scene?

69
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,715
Why should I lend it to you
when you don't want to work for me?

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,277
The guy who makes our props
has stalled.

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,516
I'd do that too.

72
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,157
But then we said we knew someone
who had the most beautiful nativity scene.

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,591
Aren't you thinking a bit too much
about nativity scenes?

74
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,837
Our teacher Jytte is really into it.

75
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,830
Is there anything I can't stand more
than people named Jytte.

76
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,669
- They're insanely crazy.
- Can we borrow it then?

77
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,556
- Then you'll get some pretzels too.
- Pretzels?

78
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,600
Okay. Just take it then.

79
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,794
But you have to promise to take good care
of it. It's very fragile.

80
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,830
Thanks,

81
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,390
Can you tell me
what that costume means to you?

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,068
That's what we wear where I'm from.

83
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,589
- Where are you from?
- Nazareth.

84
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,316
- Why do you think that?
- Because that's where I live.

85
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,514
- How long have you lived there?
- Since we moved from Egypt.

86
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,477
King Herod wanted to kill you,
and when he died, you moved home?

87
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,673
Do you also know
what happens to you later?

88
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,873
I raise a dead man
named Lazarus, -

89
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,595
- and help many sick people.

90
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,873
- Do you feel like God?
- My mother says I'm God's son.

91
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,831
- How do you get along with mom and dad?
- Good.

92
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,555
Do they have problems?
Do they drink? Fight?

93
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,594
My mom thinks
Joseph drinks a bit too much wine.

94
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,394
What do you think yourself, Jesus?

95
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,434
Is he unpleasant to you?

96
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,111
It can be annoying
always having to turn water into wine.

97
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,118
I don't think
you have it so easy, Jesus.

98
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,598
When you don't have it easy, sometimes you
feel like being someone else.

99
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,758
Someone who has mighty powers.

100
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,715
I need to make some phone calls,
so you can consider, -

101
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,516
- if you want to tell me your
real name when I come back.

102
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,192
It should be here.

103
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,356
Solhuset.

104
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,393
Yes?

105
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,558
We were going to visit one,
who's called Jesus.

106
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,713
- Hi, Jesus.
- Hi. Good to see you.

107
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,356
- Are they strict?
- There's one who asks and asks.

108
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,312
A psychologist.

109
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,432
A bit like a priest,
just without God.

110
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,677
- Put on the tunic.
- You have to go home now.

111
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,239
Josefine, hurry up now.

112
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,473
- Okay, so we'll pray it works.
- Thanks for the help.

113
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,558
- See you,
- No, you won't!

114
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,072
- It will end badly. It has to stop.
- Just a lightning-quick visit.

115
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,589
Shall we say goodbye then?

116
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,951
Goodbye, Jesus.

117
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,440
He's coming now!

118
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,557
Goodbye,

119
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,672
Where is Jesus?

120
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,189
He's gone.

121
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,957
Josef,

122
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,073
Boo!

123
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,271
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God.

124
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,995
Thank you, God,
for bringing my son back.

125
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,870
- I think you've grown.
- You look good.

126
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,754
I've found out
it's true, what you said.

127
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,080
- That I'll become a great man one day.
- How did you find that out?

128
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,317
I've looked into the coming times.

129
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,353
- Have you seen God's kingdom?
- Probably not.

130
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,394
I've seen a time
when I was remembered as God's son.

131
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,909
So you know it?

132
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,356
How good that is.

133
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,633
You can still help your father
in the workshop?

134
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,638
I have to go out and help
the weak on the roads.

135
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,709
One day I raise Lazarus.
I grow old and die of happiness.

136
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,354
Well
a

137
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,109
What about us then?
Will we be remembered too?

138
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,630
- You can believe that.
- Josef …

139
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,119
We should destroy that nativity scene.

140
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,916
We promised to return it.
When you promise something, you keep it.

141
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,237
- But still.
- Good, you came.

142
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,275
I've actually regretted that I
ever lent it to you.

143
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,950
It should on no account
fall into the wrong hands.

144
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,278
I can actually reveal to you, -

145
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,359
- that this nativity scene is magical.

146
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,632
Imagine, is that true?

147
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,799
It sounds like it doesn't
come as a surprise to you.

148
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,310
Have you used it for something
you shouldn't have?

149
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,433
I can do anything.
We're all gods, right?

150
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,758
Ouch, you got me there.
You see…

151
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,318
… it's not for everyone
to be fiddling with this.

152
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,149
And I am the guardian of the nativity set.

153
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,831
I must ensure
that no one misuses its magic.

154
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,835
What can it do?

155
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,239
If you know it, you know it,
and otherwise you won't find out.

156
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,398
- Was there anything else?
- Nah.

157
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,035
Yeah … Do you think you could
do me and Oskar a favor?

158
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,276
That depends on what.

159
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,632
You have to call Solhuset and say
that you are Jesus' father.

160
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,310
- God knows I'm not.
- Not that Jesus.

161
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,548
Just say that you are the father of the boy
who plays Jesus in the nativity play, -

162
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,038
- and that he is completely normal,
just likes to act.

163
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,913
What do I get in return?

164
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,270
You know what?

165
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,873
You can come work for me
when I expand the shop.

166
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,514
- Okay?
- Yeah yeah. Right?

167
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,553
- Great. Bye then.
- Bye.

168
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,430
He is pretty weird,
that Thorsen.

169
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,995
- Maybe he's Satan.
- Satan?

170
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,038
- He's not that weird.
- Isn't he?

171
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,756
Okay. He knows that you can travel
to Nazareth with the nativity set.

172
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,474
We have to stay far away from him.

173
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,912
You're just scared that
I'll go down to Jesus again.

174
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,918
I'll make sure not to do that.
But Thorsen is decent enough.

175
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,908
He helped us at least
with calling Solhuset.

176
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,112
- Hi, Jesus!
- Hi, Jesus. Are you okay?

177
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,470
I'm completely okay.

178
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,272
- Thanks for the help.
- No problem.

179
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,031
- Won't you play with us?
- I just need to think.

180
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,596
Because now I know
that I am humanity's savior.

181
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,837
So you'll never play with us again?

182
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,635
Okay. One single game.

183
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,956
Come on with it, Jesper.

184
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,079
- What?
- With a "sorry".

185
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,398
- Why should I say sorry?
- You wanted to get Jesus into the orphanage.

186
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,037
Why should I say sorry?
The boy was just acting.

187
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,118
It's him who should say sorry to me.

188
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,111
They were pretty confused down at Solhuset
when they had talked to his father.

189
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,235
- You could just have asked me.
- Yeah, you could. So say sorry.

190
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,909
But okay, sorry.

191
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,999
Jesus is at least good at
walking on water.

192
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,796
Exactly, Lukas. With a bit of good imagination
and some grit in the hair, anything can be done.

193
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,432
Dad?

194
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,358
Does Satan exist in reality?

195
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,515
Now stop it, Josefine.
Have you met him too now?

196
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,950
Oskar just thought that.

197
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,678
When we do something bad to others,
Satan plays a trick on us.

198
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,917
But he is not a person
one can meet.

199
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,069
- I'll sign under that.
- Okay. I'll tell Oskar.

200
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,352
Dear God. I'm glad
that Jesus came home.

201
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,633
And I know full well,
I shouldn't visit him again.

202
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,595
- But I miss him already.
- Look what I've made for Jesus.

203
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,317
- You can't give Jesus an elf hat.
— J0.

204
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,479
Lukas, it's too late now.
Jesus has gone home.

205
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,317
I want you to
take care of Jesus, okay? Amen.
