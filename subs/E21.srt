1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,115
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,709
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,679
Okay.
After having walked all night —

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,555
- when Josefine, Simon and Judas
arrive at the Roman city of Caesarea.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,356
Jesus has started at gladiator school,
where he is trained by Pardos.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,278
(Jesus roars)

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,711
Jesus is not
interested in coming along.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,514
- What are you doing here?
- We're here to save you.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,119
I don't want to be saved.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,438
Thorsen goes down to Nazareth
to stop Josefine.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,757
Your friends have
a very sick friend out in the desert.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,999
Josefine and Simon trick Jesus into believing
that Judas has been bitten by a snake.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,031
I won't heal him.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,597
Pardos tells Jesus
that he must help his friend.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,916
Meanwhile, Judas gets a visit from Thorsen.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,953
- Who are you?
- He claims to be God.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,192
He doesn't look particularly sick.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,198
- He's about to die.
- I'm perfectly fine.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,153
Judas reveals
that the snakebite is a lie.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,191
This is the second time you've lied to me.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,632
Jesus gets mad
and goes back to gladiator school.

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,277
In her evening prayer, Josefine asks God
to intervene directly.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,393
Because God is the only one
who can make Jesus understand.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,114
Dear God, hear my prayer.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,151
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,830
laid in the soil like flower seeds

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,319
shoot up and sprout and twist around

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,071
she understands nothing at all

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,068
hours feel like days

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,511
and weeks a thousand years

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,629
came to look back

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,515
to a world of yesterday

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,316
Jesus and Josefine

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,991
homeless heartache

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,558
but Jesus makes Josefine

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,116
believe in miracles

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,198
when she wavers

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,951
Jesus and Josefine

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,756
faithless time machine

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,592
tempter's concubine

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,758
she needs miracles

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,072
when she wavers

43
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,350
Wake up, Simon.

44
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,757
- Simon.
- What?

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,837
We're going to have to
talk to Jesus again.

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,430
- But he won't.
- You want him back too.

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,189
Yeah yeah, but … We'll try once more.

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,391
First we need something to eat.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,752
Good idea, except
we don't have any bread.

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,473
- Where did you get them from?
- I got them from God, actually.

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,070
Well, God just stopped by
and took some bread with him?

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,670
He was actually sitting right here
and baked them from two stones.

53
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,594
- What did he say then?
- That Jesus is going to be a gladiator.

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,717
- You're lying.
- Why do you never believe me?

55
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,754
- You can't be trusted.
- You don't trust God either?

56
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,350
- Yes, I do.
- Then let's leave Jesus alone.

57
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,075
- But I promised Josefine …
- God will be furious.

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,115
- I'm going home now.
- I'll come with you.

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,553
- Simon, you promised.
- I trust God more than you.

60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,077
(Pardo groans)

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,077
Can you lie down now, boy!

62
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,909
- I'll never lie down!
- Then take this!

63
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,634
(panting and groaning)

64
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,637
- I'll get you down.
- I just need to sit for a bit.

65
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,873
There, I got you after all.

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,071
I'll be back in a bit.

67
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,956
(it boils and rumbles)

68
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,791
Where am I?

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,709
Hi, don't you remember me?
I'm Josefine's friend, Jesus.

70
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,718
- 58, hurry up, you're behind.
- My arms are tired.

71
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,832
You have to, otherwise we won't get food.

72
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,397
You can't tell me how to get to
gladiator school, right?

73
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,237
(Jytte sobs)

74
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,597
Why did you say there were angels
when it's not true?

75
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,031
- I'll never do it again.
- We don't believe in angels.

76
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,549
There are angels.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,912
What is this place?

78
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,432
(groans)

79
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,394
- You know that bulb has to light up.
- I can't do more.

80
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,751
- Oskar?
- Should I swing the whip?

81
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,552
Oskar!

82
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,310
Do you really think
he can hear what you're saying?

83
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,708
Who are you?

84
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,519
I am nothing.

85
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,837
Because the one I was supposed to be,
I'll never become.

86
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,112
- Why not?
- Why do you ask so stupidly?

87
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,117
I am you as an adult. I am Jesus.

88
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,752
The Jesus who is the Son of God.

89
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,553
But I will never
get to exist.

90
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,955
Are you me?

91
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,152
You held the whole world in your hand.

92
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,315
But look what happens,

93
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,430
This is what the world looks like,
just because you want to be a gladiator.

94
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,279
I don't want to die on a cross.

95
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,272
And so people have to live and die
without hope of salvation in such a world?

96
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,239
Can you feel good, little Jesus?
Sometimes one must sacrifice oneself.

97
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,590
What should I do?

98
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,551
You know the answer.

99
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,197
(Oskar groans)

100
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,394
Are you sitting there sleeping?
Go over and get some water and fight!

101
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,793
And let's pick up the pace.
This time I'll smash you.

102
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,998
- I have to go.
- That's impossible according to your contract.

103
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,909
- I have to.
- Is it too hard for you?

104
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,910
I didn't think you were a weakling.
Did you come to make a fool of me?

105
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,954
I think I understand.

106
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,713
You could have become the greatest.
You could have shut down the Colosseum.

107
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,673
And gotten laurel wreaths.

108
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,436
Thanks for the fight.

109
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,316
Farewell, master,

110
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,674
- Aren't we going to eat?
- You only think about food.

111
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,871
I need something in my gut.
We're short 24 crosses.

112
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,629
I'm staying here lying down,
until Jesus comes back.

113
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,312
- You can't just lie there.
- I can assure you I can.

114
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,389
- There's washing and baking and …
— Not until I say so!

115
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,750
(knocking)

116
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,791
Thanks, God.

117
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,468
Happy days in Nazareth.

118
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,592
Jesus is on his way back.

119
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,394
Is that true?

120
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,592
But the road will be long, -

121
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,633
- and there are snakes in the desert.

122
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,877
Simon and Judas, wait a minute.

123
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,595
- Judas, I want to ask you something.
— Yes?

124
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,679
- What did God look like?
- He looked nice.

125
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,351
- Was he very big down there?
- Of course God is big.

126
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,074
Did he have such a deep voice?

127
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,037
Yes,

128
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,074
And he said,
Jesus should be a gladiator?

129
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,794
Then it might not have been God.

130
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,752
Who would it be then?

131
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,552
Satan.

132
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,435
Satan wouldn't dare impersonate God, would he?

133
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,108
Satan dares quite a lot.

134
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,193
But luckily I have this one.

135
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,912
What is it?

136
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,271
I don't know, but it helps.
Are you coming?

137
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,155
I don't think I dare,
if it has anything to do with Satan.

138
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,999
Fine. Then I'll do it myself.

139
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,430
Okay. Good luck.

140
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,795
Judas …

141
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,436
Josephine!

142
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,874
- Josephine?
- She sends her regards.

143
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,914
- Who are you?
- A merchant. My name is Natas.

144
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,796
- Where did Josephine go?
- She's gone home.

145
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,189
- Sit down, my friend.
- No, I want to catch up with her.

146
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,358
- I can help you.
- No thanks.

147
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,997
Yes, I have some bread.
And it's a long way to Nazareth.

148
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,272
Man does not live by
bread alone, Natas. Farewell.

149
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,040
Jesus, watch out for that guy!

150
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,030
I know who it is. Satan.

151
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,234
Yes, there you see, Josefine.
I really needed your help.

152
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,908
He saw through me right away.

153
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,270
(laughs maliciously)

154
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,632
There's nothing left
but to congratulate you two on the victory.

155
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,310
I'm an old sportsman.

156
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,397
Congratulations.

157
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,756
Get away! Come here!

158
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,270
- Josefine.
- Screw being with her.

159
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,711
Josefine?

160
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,870
- Like that!
- What happened?

161
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,674
- I've lost the package.
- This one?

162
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,911
Come on, Judas!

163
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,919
- Jesus!
- How strong are you then?

164
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,237
Will you get up again,
if your body is crushed?

165
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,034
How strong are you, Jesus of Nazareth?

166
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,553
Well, it'll be exciting to see,
if your father has really forsaken you.

167
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,991
- But you didn't want any help.
- Stop!

168
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,589
I thought
we were done with each other.

169
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,392
(thunderclap)

170
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,310
- A feather?
- Are you threatening me with a feather?

171
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,238
Yes!

172
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,237
(Thorsen laughs)

173
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,871
(thunderclap)

174
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,789
(Thorsen screams)

175
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,109
Now he's gone.
Farewell, Thorsen, you maggot.

176
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,069
(snake hisses)

177
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,593
Thanks for using my feather.

178
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,436
Your prayer was heard, Josefine.

179
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,189
Jesus, I think there's someone
waiting for you at home.

180
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,275
Just hope nothing has happened.

181
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,957
Something has happened,
but now it's over.

182
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,275
He's not dead, is he?

183
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,795
He's on his way.

184
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,075
On his way to Nazareth.

185
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,508
We'll continue tomorrow.

186
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,754
- But I thought it was God, after all.
- Judas, you are forgiven.

187
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,679
- Think, that one can't tell the difference.
- You can't tell the difference.

188
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,475
- You believed in it too.
- I hadn't seen him, after all.

189
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,478
You've tasted his bread, haven't you?

190
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,670
What's wrong?

191
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,111
If it weren't for him,
I never would have met you.

192
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,916
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have
understood who I need to look after.

193
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,236
- Shall I teach you a prayer?
— Yes.

194
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,637
- Our Father, who art in heaven.
- I know that one well.

195
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,071
Hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come.

196
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,558
Thy will be done in heaven,
as it is on earth.

197
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,069
Give us this day our daily bread, -

198
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,590
- and forgive us our debts,
as we also forgive our debtors.

199
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,429
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

200
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,236
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory
forever. Amen.

201
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,396
Ugh, I mean.

202
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,673
If you keep
talking so loud, I can't sleep.
