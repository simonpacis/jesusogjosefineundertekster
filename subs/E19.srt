1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,835
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,840
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,232
Okay.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,399
The angel visits Joseph and Mary
and says, all hope is lost.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,239
What has been foretold
will not happen.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,159
The savior who was born
refuses to save.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,920
The time of miracles is over.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,317
Simon and Judas decide
to look for Jesus.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,195
You search in the cities east of Nazareth,
I search to the west.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,110
Oskar and Josefine meet Jytte,
who is not called Jytte, but number 12.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,030
She has a secret school,
where she tells the children about angels.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,472
- Angels are not welcome here.
- Show respect for the overbo!

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,672
Finally they meet the so-called overbo:
It is the devil himself. Thorsen.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,552
47.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,231
They try to sneak back to
the nativity play, but it's gone.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,792
Stop that lie of a story!

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,437
Jytte is seized by the guards
and thrown into a dungeon.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,315
In her evening prayer, Josefine prays to
get up to Thorsen.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,354
They must find the nativity play,
so they can travel back to Jesus.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,394
Tomorrow you must help us to
get up to Thorsen.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,397
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,036
laid in the earth like flower seeds

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,394
shoots and sprouts and winds around

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,116
she understands nothing at all

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,359
hours feel like days

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,677
and weeks a thousand years

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,874
came to look back

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,789
to a world of yesterday

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,596
Jesus and Josefine

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,351
homeless heartache

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,918
but Jesus makes Josefine

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,396
believe in miracles

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,433
when she wavers

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,316
Jesus and Josefine

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,036
faithless time machine

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,872
tempter's concubine

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,719
she needs miracles

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,199
when she wavers

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,994
Hi, Simon. Can I tempt you with something?

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,031
- What's wrong?
- It was more fun when Jesus was here.

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,879
- I get an idea.
- What?

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,392
We write down everything
we've experienced with Jesus.

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,354
- We'll get rich.
- I'd rather have Jesus back.

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,279
Caesarea.

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,758
Caesarea.

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,429
- Why do you say "Caesarea"?
- I see where Jesus is. In Caesarea.

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,232
What is Jesus doing in a Roman city?

48
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,829
He thinks he's free,
but he's captured.

49
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,831
- Then we must free him.
- Only one can free him. It's the girl.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,474
The girl from the North.

51
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,035
Now there's food. Eat it fast,
so we can get to work.

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,358
- So the overboss doesn't get mad.
- Oh, I'm so hungry.

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,550
Come, Oskar.
Now I'll get you something to eat.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,596
What does the boy without a number want here?
You don't belong here. Get lost!

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,396
- Do you realize he's starving?
- He's not getting any of ours.

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,154
- He's actually my friend.
- What do you need friends for, 47?

57
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,876
- I want a friend too.
— Shut up and eat, 58.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,878
Sit down,
I'll tell you something.

59
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,835
Back when I was a little under-god,
I wished for a friend too.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,999
- But I did better without.
- Mom, friends are important.

61
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,876
Come, Oskar.

62
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,073
(siren wails)

63
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,475
More coal on! More coal on!

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,798
- We have to find that nativity play now.
- But how do we get up there?

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,710
- What are you doing?
- Going to the only one who can help.

66
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,669
Where are you going?

67
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,873
- Can we spit on the prisoner?
- Then spit. And spit for me too.

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,350
Hi, Jytte.

69
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,711
No, how strange.
I think I've just dreamed about you.

70
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,435
- What did you dream?
- Imagine, I've forgotten.

71
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,234
How do we get up to the overboss?

72
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,036
Everyone who's tried has been sentenced
to life in the room machines, so watch out.

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,674
- We need to go up there.
- Have you spat anything?

74
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,472
(spits)

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,275
- Stop it.
- Good, that's how she should have it.

76
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,074
Stop it.

77
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,668
- Sorry, Jytte.
- It's okay.

78
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,552
We'd better go.

79
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,234
No, wait a bit.

80
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,594
Now I remember.
I dreamed I was visited by an angel.

81
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,793
And she said to me,
that I should give you this one.

82
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,353
- What is it?
- I don't know.

83
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,030
She said it can only be opened
if you really need it.

84
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,834
And I mean "really",

85
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,759
What's in it
can only be used once.

86
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,997
Just once.

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,116
Okay. Thanks.

88
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,912
(boiling and rumbling)

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,390
Now we just need to find some
9 9
way to get up there.

90
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,716
Yeah, but how?

91
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,194
47?

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,109
— You can't skip work.
- I work for the overboss.

93
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,869
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do. Isn't that right?

94
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,630
We help him see
that everyone does their work.

95
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,115
I don't believe that.

96
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,754
Then we'll probably
have to report her.

97
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,439
You won't do that.

98
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,349
We'll say you're using
your work time to talk to us.

99
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,269
(siren)
Can we get the pressure up?

100
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,711
Get to work then.
It's your fault the pressure's dropping.

101
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,389
We'll never get past him.

102
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,910
I'll get him out of the way.

103
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,753
— Don't touch the landlord's property.
- The landlord is a fool!

104
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,838
(laughs maliciously)

105
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,555
Oskar?

106
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,874
I'll grumble at him.

107
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,715
(door creaks)

108
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,479
This is our apartment after all.

109
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,909
(church bells toll in the distance)

110
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,879
47, I've been waiting for you. Welcome.

111
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,396
- This is our apartment.
- Now it's mine.

112
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,037
Would you like some buns?
I baked them myself.

113
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,199
They're simply perfect.
Now watch this.

114
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,277
(egg timer rings)

115
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,554
They've had … ten minutes.

116
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,550
At 180 degrees, Neither a minute
too much or a minute too little.

117
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,668
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- I don't drink coffee.

118
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,234
Then I'll just have one myself.

119
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,516
Why the hell
doesn't this shit work?

120
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,191
(gong sounds)

121
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,552
How many times do I have to tell you?
More coal on it!

122
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,309
(sirens sound in the distance)

123
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,828
(coffee machine sputters)

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,512
There.

125
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,917
Ah yes. You know what?

126
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,511
I've always wanted
to come up into the light.

127
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,759
And now I'm here. Thanks to you.

128
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,030
Yeah, fie on Satan.

129
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,754
Whoa whoa whoa ….

130
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,356
There is no Satan.
We don't know that word here.

131
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,111
- I actually think it's you.
- Yeah, you could say that.

132
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,271
But after you got Jesus to
give up his future as a prophet, -

133
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,392
- God has abandoned humanity.

134
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,673
And so we've all become gods,
there's no difference between good and evil, -

135
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,077
- and so we
don't need any Satan.

136
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,273
No, I … I want …

137
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,837
I'd much rather have you
call me grandpa.

138
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,559
- Then "worst-grandpa". That's up to you.
- You're not my grandpa.

139
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,471
No, but I can be
the whole world's grandpa.

140
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,877
I can be a real grandpa.

141
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,719
With spruce in my hair. Now watch.

142
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,796
(muffled explosions)

143
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,151
That's how the world should look.

144
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,432
That's the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

145
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,916
I think it's unbelievably beautiful.

146
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,950
How glad I am
that I chose you for the task.

147
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,950
- Why did you choose me?
- Jesus saw right through me.

148
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,157
A young, pretty December girl like you,
who thinks a bit too much about herself.

149
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,434
That's what it took to get Jesus to
give up the idea of being God's son.

150
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,519
Yes, love makes you blind,
as they say.

151
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,396
But I can comfort you with the fact that
he had a long and good life.

152
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,114
Did he?

153
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,154
You know what?
I have something I want to show you.

154
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,717
Now just listen.
This one is simply so exciting.

155
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,673
It's the history of the Roman Empire.

156
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,232
Are you listening?

157
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,477
You talked about
how Jesus had a long life.

158
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,111
Ow!

159
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,311
- Welcome, boy without a number.
- Then you can sit and think about it.

160
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,391
She'll manage.

161
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,876
- Has she gotten up there?
- I think so.

162
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,635
(sighs)

163
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,469
There's one thing about the superintendent.

164
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,831
He's too good to tempt.

165
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,158
Yes, thanks. He hasn't done anything else
in the month of December.

166
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,954
I hope she's strong.

167
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,913
Otherwise, all hope is lost.

168
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,718
(Thorsen hums)

169
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,354
Yes, here it is.

170
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,235
"The famous gladiator,
Jesus of Nazareth, -

171
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,992
- celebrated the triumph of his life in Rome,
where he defeated Barabbas.

172
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,719
It was that fight that gave Jesus
the nickname 'king of the gladiators'.

173
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,948
Afterwards, Jesus retired,
had nine children and a happy old age."

174
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,311
Try looking.

175
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,031
Here you can just see,

176
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,438
Yes, shouldn't we then
let Jesus rest in peace?

177
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,473
- No!
- Goodbye, Thorsen.

178
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,275
Now stop that.
Jesus has chosen his future.

179
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,789
He can still choose it again.

180
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,996
Do you really want him to hang
there on the cross like a Christmas elf?

181
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,395
Do you realize how much it hurts -

182
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,354
- to have nails hammered through
both hands and both feet?

183
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,711
Do you really want to subject
the poor guy to that?

184
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,549
Do him the service
of letting him grow old and happy.

185
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,154
Listen now. There's something
I have to show you.

186
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,989
I can do more for
you and your family, -

187
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,317
- than you ever dream of.

188
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,838
No, Lukas. It's Josephine's turn.

189
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,156
- Thanks.
- Doesn't it look cozy?

190
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,636
Then there are buns.
It's Josephine's favorite recipe.

191
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,149
That's how you can have it if you stay.

192
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,231
- Now we just need grandpa.
- Hi, grandpa.

193
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,555
Hi, everyone. I have gifts with me,

194
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,878
- No, that just won't do.
- For all of you.

195
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,314
Is it because I'm here?

196
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,837
You can have it the way you want it.
I can disappear.

197
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,397
I can move down to my old shop,
if that's what you want.

198
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,955
Now look.

199
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,149
Look, Oskar is with us.

200
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,272
- Today is Josephine's birthday.
- Christmas is canceled.

201
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,874
Now you have your birthday to yourself.
Isn't that what you've wished for?

202
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,751
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

203
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,272
- And then the long one.
- Hoorayyy!

204
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,837
Wasn't it about time then -

205
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,508
- to get that finger away?

206
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,590
You can become powerful.
You can become over-gods.

207
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,510
You can get all the under-gods
to slave for you.

208
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,951
Could you imagine that?

209
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,357
In reality, you're just like me.

210
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,038
Like this.

211
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,196
(laughs)

212
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,879
(sighs with relief)

213
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,230
Unfortunately, Thorsen.

214
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,715
No! No!

215
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,911
No, no!

216
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,236
- Get away from us.
- Don't.

217
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,671
- She is Satan's emissary!
- Of course not.

218
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,156
- I was Satan's emissary.
- And what are you now?

219
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,319
- I'm here to get Jesus back.
- Why should I trust you?

220
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,318
- Because you have to.
- Josefine, good you came.

221
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,398
Joshua said that only
the girl from the North can save Jesus.

222
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,637
- Where is he?
- In Caesarea. We can be there tomorrow.

223
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,400
- I'm coming along.
- No, Maria.

224
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,353
Wait here, I'll pack
some bread for you.

225
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,676
I have to remember this one.

226
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,394
Boy without number, wake up.

227
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,838
I dreamed,
that 47 is on the way to the Savior.

228
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,671
Will you pray with me?

229
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,039
Dear angel who protects us.

230
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,073
Let 47 arrive safely, -

231
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,795
- and let the power of evil be broken.

232
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,472
Amen.

233
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,272
Amen.
