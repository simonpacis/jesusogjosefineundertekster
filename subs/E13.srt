1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,793
Are you sitting comfortably in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,073
Jesus has discovered
the manger's secret -

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,078
- and suddenly stands in Thorsen's shop.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,953
Jesus appears in the schoolyard.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,232
Josefine and Oskar
hurry off with Jesus.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,874
We're switching to you.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,629
They show him the church.
Jesus sees the crucified man …

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,389
Why is there a crucified man
in my father's house?

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,319
… but doesn't understand,
it's himself.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,512
That's the man
the Romans executed.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,918
Oskar wants to get Jesus home
to Nazareth as quickly as possible.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,398
But when they get to Thorsen's shop,
it's closed.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,991
- "Closed due to freedom"?
- Can't I go home then?

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,873
Yes, if you sleep at my place tonight.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,756
Josefine invites Jesus home,
and the family greets Jesus.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,112
Jesper and Louise think
he's an ordinary boy.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,437
Is that you, Jesus? Hi hi.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,031
Jesper's back gives out,
and Jesus heals him on the spot.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,155
- In God's name, heal that man.
- It's completely gone now.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,036
That's why we call him Jesus.
Jesus with the magic hands.

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,909
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,318
laid in the earth like flower seeds

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,389
shoots and sprouts and twines around

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,230
she understands nothing at all

25
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,274
hours feel like days

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,996
and weeks a thousand years

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,989
came to look back

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,478
to a world of yesterday

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,877
Jesus and Josefine

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,710
homeless heartache

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,278
Jesus makes Josefine

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,517
believe in miracles

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,870
when she wavers

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,830
Jesus and Josefine

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,431
faithless time machine

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,555
the tempter's concubine

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,471
she needs miracles
and love

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,114
when she wavers

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,190
Jesus!

40
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,151
Jesus!

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,510
Jesus!

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,597
Something bad has happened to him. Jesus
would never disappear on a Sabbath.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,473
Maybe he's out thinking about life.

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,559
I'd do the same if I
were told I was God's son.

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,958
I asked him to fix this
yesterday. Now I'll do it myself.

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,277
I'll go out and look for him.
Stay here if he shows up.

47
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,349
Pray that he hasn't been
beaten to death by the Romans.

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,793
Those couple of Romans here in town
wouldn't hurt a fly. Or …

49
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,629
- Haven't you baked at all today?
- No … Today it's the baker's bread.

50
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,389
- How's the back?
- Pretty good.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,559
- It was Jesus who healed you.
- No, it wasn't.

52
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,515
It was like it was a nerve
that had gotten pinched in the lower back.

53
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,192
- Right when he touched me, I think …
- Maybe Jesus has healing powers.

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,631
You should try to be
a bit more open.

55
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,434
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Did you sleep well?

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,710
Is that sabbath bread?

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,476
The baker just called it filone bread.

58
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,275
- Did you remember to bless it?
- No.

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,069
We don't usually do that here.
My wife is a priest, sure, but …

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,999
May I just bless it?

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,751
If you think it's going to
taste better, you're welcome to.

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,636
Blessed are you, Lord,
our God, -

63
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,197
- King of the universe, who brings forth
bread from the earth. Amen.

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,432
- Do you always do that before you eat?
- No, my father usually does it.

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,757
Or my stepfather.
My father is in Heaven.

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,669
- So your father is dead?
- Nah, my father is God.

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,472
And so your stepfather is Joseph?

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,039
That's just what he's called.

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,758
Not to butt in, and it's Christmas
and pine needles in the hair and all that,

70
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,715
- Do you really believe you're God's son?
- Come on, let's go now. You need to go home.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,991
Jesus ….

72
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,797
I just want to say, it was
really positive meeting you.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,275
Have a safe trip home.

74
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,314
Give me that bread there,

75
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,994
You shouldn't have said that about
God being your father.

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,829
- Why would I lie?
- To avoid stupid questions.

77
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,953
I don't mind them.
Except if they're from my mom.

78
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,119
Have you thought about telling
your mom where you've been?

79
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,630
- I don't think so.
- But then you're lying.

80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,753
I'll just say I met an angel.
So I'm not lying.

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,676
You're an angel.

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,479
Well, before I leave,
I want to say goodbye to Oskar.

83
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,591
Jesus, wait.

84
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,517
Hi, Oskar.
Are you saying goodbye to Jesus?

85
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,154
God, what happened?

86
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,029
- Josefine the degu is dead.
- Oh no.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,275
It was just lying completely still.

88
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,798
I want to bury it out in the front yard.

89
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,357
- Why don't you bring it back to life?
- I don't think I'm allowed to.

90
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,633
- You do that when you get older.
- Do I raise a dead degu?

91
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,073
No, but a dead man.
His name was Lazarus, I think. Right?

92
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,158
- I don't know any Lazarus.
- Do you want to hear it?

93
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,636
- Yes.
- Hold on. I need to find it.

94
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,152
Are you …. Are you Joseph? The carpenter?

95
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,312
Sorry, is it something with my son?

96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,230
Your son is the boy
with fire from his finger, right?

97
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,876
I don't know.
He can do some strange things.

98
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,755
Well, then it's your son
I've met.

99
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,633
You haven't taken him prisoner, have you?

100
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,719
No no, we could never dream of
taking the boy prisoner.

101
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,036
We certainly don't dare.

102
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,869
I've come to ask
if you can repair that one.

103
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,753
It's the lid that's wrong with.

104
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,750
- Not today, it's the Sabbath.
- I'm going to Caesarea tomorrow.

105
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,111
I want to take my travel chest
with me home.

106
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,797
Be glad my wife is out.
She would be furious.

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,070
I'll pay well.

108
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,395
- I have no more wood.
- The manger. What about this manger?

109
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,799
- That's excellent wood. We'll use it.
- That's where my son lay when he was little.

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,391
Excellent. The boy with fire
out of his finger lay there.

111
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,229
I absolutely must use that wood
for my coffin.

112
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,871
(coins clink in the purse)

113
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,595
- It'll be ready tomorrow.
- Good. Excellent.

114
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,589
A lot of people are crying because
Lazarus is dead.

115
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,189
Then you look up to heaven and say:

116
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,234
"Father, I thank you
because you heard me." Then you shout:

117
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,911
"Lazarus! Come out!"
And then a living Lazarus comes.

118
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,432
- Do I really do all that?
- You become quite fantastic as an adult.

119
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,350
- Then my mother is right.
- I've also started to believe in you.

120
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,750
Me too.

121
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,110
Josefine dear, open your eyes.
I ask you in God's name.

122
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,950
That's too wild.

123
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,596
Father, I thank you,
because you have heard me.

124
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,836
- Thanks, Jesus.
- I didn't even know I could.

125
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,158
- What else does that book say?
- It doesn't say anything special.

126
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,636
Doesn't it say anything about
when I die?

127
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,153
- No. Why would it?
- I just lived so long ago.

128
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,195
- I must be dead now.
- It actually doesn't say anything about that.

129
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,994
Quite strange.

130
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,752
But it says something about …
that you become very wise and old.

131
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,431
Does it really say that?
But now I really want to go home.

132
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,712
We have to get him past Thorsen.

133
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,997
Hey, Oskar.
What can I help you with?

134
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,079
I just wanted to ask
if Josefine was here?

135
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,716
Nah. I haven't seen her today.

136
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,753
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

137
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,671
- No, what a mess.
- Sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

138
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,348
No no. It's okay.

139
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,397
You can
help me clean up, right?

140
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,150
- Then goodbye, Jesus.
- You're coming tomorrow, right? See you.

141
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,629
You just have to push.

142
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,995
Nothing happens.

143
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,678
Joseph?

144
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,589
What are you doing?
You're not working, are you?

145
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,395
- No! It's the Sabbath.
- Good. I thought for a moment…

146
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,512
I was standing thinking about Jesus.
I wonder where he is.

147
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,953
I've been all over Nazareth. No one
has seen or heard anything of him.

148
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,836
- Just hope he hasn't been kidnapped.
- Who would kidnap him?

149
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,989
There are many evil forces that will
do anything to stop God's son.

150
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,509
There. That's good, Oskar.
That's good.

151
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,796
What the heck?

152
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,790
Hi, so you are here after all. I just
told Oskar you weren't here.

153
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,629
We were supposed to find costumes for him here
for the nativity play.

154
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,831
Who's this guy?

155
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,675
It's just … Jens.
Jens from our class.

156
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,713
He's going to play grown-up Jesus.

157
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,434
Hi, Jens.

158
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,198
What do you say to this one, huh?

159
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,676
That's nice.
We're off now. Bye bye.

160
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,670
Watch out that the nativity play doesn't go to your
heads. You don't think about anything else.

161
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,556
- And it didn't work at all?
- There must be an explanation.

162
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,274
It's Thorsen who did it.

163
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,917
Now Jesus is stuck in the present.
So he can't do all that stuff in the Bible.

164
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,274
- Why would Thorsen do that?
- Because he doesn't like Jesus.

165
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,439
- So can I not go home?
— We'll figure out how.

166
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,677
- If we can.
- Of course we can.

167
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,555
You'll sleep here until tomorrow,
and then we'll try again.

168
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,833
I'm thinking of
dropping that baking book.

169
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,239
- I don't know if that's really me.
- You have to make your baking book.

170
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,552
- You think so?
- Yes. It's a smashing good idea.

171
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,955
I believe in it.

172
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,038
You might be right.

173
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,196
- Hi.
- Hi.

174
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,517
Hi, Jesus.
I thought you'd left.

175
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,714
He was supposed to.
But the flight was delayed.

176
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,994
Yeah, Jesus' parents …
were on a trip to Egypt.

177
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,753
- Egypt?
- It's fine, you're here.

178
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,555
But I need some peace to
write my sermon.

179
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,309
My mom says,
that there's only peace in Heaven.

180
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,990
Here on Earth we have to live in discord.

181
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,111
Does she say that?

182
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,948
That's …
That's actually not so dumb.

183
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,152
Simple and … straightforward.

184
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,912
You, Jesus … I'll borrow that
for my sermon, if that's okay.

185
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,588
- Okay.
— Thanks.

186
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,916
Come.

187
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,038
I pray you take care of Josefine
and her house -

188
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,597
- and help me safely home
to Nazareth tomorrow. Amen.

189
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,717
It would otherwise be nice,
if you could stay here.

190
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,596
Then I can't do the things
in the big book. What is it I do?

191
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,157
All sorts. Heals the sick,
makes the blind see and that stuff,

192
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,718
- Think, that they wrote it down.
- Me and Oskar are in it too.

193
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,833
— The Bible has actually gotten better.
-— Has it?

194
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,192
- I want to be in the Bible too.
- Lukas, be quiet and sleep.

195
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,630
- Goodnight, Josefine.
- Goodnight, Jesus.

196
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,992
I'll get you home tomorrow.
