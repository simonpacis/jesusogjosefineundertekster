1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,714
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,117
- Okay.
- When we read today's gospel …

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,393
It's Sunday,
and Louise is going to preach in church.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,232
- Then a girl came from a country in the North.
- Josefine pricks up her ears.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,874
Josefine questions Jesper
about the girl from the North.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,437
- Jesper says that everyone knows her.
- You know the girl from the North, right?

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,598
- Yes, definitely.
- What was her name?

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,429
- Is it in the Bible?
- She was just one who helped Jesus.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,350
And Josefine discovers that she
has been written into the Bible.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,676
What should I call those buns?
Girl from the North-buns?

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,509
Josefine takes them with her
when she visits Jesus.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,193
If Jesus wants to abolish Christmas Eve,
Josefine will teach him to walk on water.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,157
- I can't do that.
- You just have to believe that you can.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,510
Simon and Judas see it,
and Judas tells on him to Joseph and Mary.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,597
- What?
- On the water?

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,158
Maria scolds Jesus. He must not
use his divine power for nonsense.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,989
I never want to see you here again.
Get out of here.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,111
- What date is Christmas Eve?
- The 24th, as usual.

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,111
When Josefine comes home, she discovers
that Jesus hasn't moved Christmas.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,038
What's his name?

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,995
- His name is Jesus.
- Oskar doesn't believe that.

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,593
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,759
laid in the earth like flower seeds

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,239
shoots and sprouts and winds around

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,150
she understands nothing at all

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,069
hours feel like days

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,274
and weeks a thousand years

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,429
came to look back

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,394
to a world of yesterday

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,628
Jesus and Josefine

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,072
homeless heartache

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,400
but Jesus gets Josefine

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,990
to believe in miracles

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,078
when she wavers

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,990
Jesus and Josefine

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,637
faithless time machine

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,392
the tempter's concubine

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,913
she needs miracles
and love

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,749
when she wavers

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,036
(cock crow)

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,158
Josefine. Josefine.
You are so beautiful.

42
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,989
Your eyes behind the veil are like doves.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,716
Your hair is like a flock of goats,
that wave down the mountain.

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,356
Joseph. Come and listen for a moment.

45
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,950
Your lips are like scarlet thread.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,472
- Your mouth is lovely.
- Jesus has fallen in love.

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,592
Your temple is like
a bursting pomegranate.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,756
He heard that in the synagogue.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,080
Yes, it's Solomon's Song of Songs.
The most beautiful place in the holy book.

50
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,034
So he's not in love after all.
He's just doing homework.

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,196
Don't you understand anything at all?

52
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,234
That crazy girl from the North
has turned his head.

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,556
Jesus is 12 years old.

54
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,355
How old were you
when you started chasing girls?

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,917
- Yeah, I can't remember that. Come on.
- But never …

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,872
- He's way too young for that.
- Come on, stop it.

57
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,435
Josefine, you are so beautiful.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,430
Your lips are like scarlet thread.
Your mouth is lovely.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,670
- So there are 16 days left until Christmas.
- I can't stand it any longer.

60
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,759
I actually like
looking forward to something.

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,191
- It tickles so nicely in the stomach.
- Are you in love?

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,872
No, I just like Christmas.
Of course I'm in love with you.

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,548
Pst, Mom.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,795
- Josefine is in love.
- Is that true?

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,798
In the evening she whispers about one
who is sweet.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,152
- What are you talking about?
- Uh, nothing. Nothing important.

67
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,316
Did you sleep well?

68
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,117
No, I dreamed that someone had promised me to
move Christmas, but he didn't do it.

69
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,518
That sounds like a good old-fashioned
Josefine dream, I think.

70
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,874
- Don't you want some heart bread?
- Isn't that just regular French bread?

71
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,038
I want to call it something fun
for the baking book.

72
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,314
Then I can tell about the young man
who repairs the young woman's bike.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,638
The young woman invites him home,
because she has baked bread.

74
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,755
And when she hands the bread to him,
she touches something in his heart.

75
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,193
And he in hers. That's the story of
how dad and mom met.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,598
That one goes in the book too.
And you get some cornflakes.

77
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,519
- Will you fetch Lukas?
- Why?

78
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,678
I have to hold a meeting,
and dad has to go to the chiropractor.

79
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,952
- I have an important appointment.
- You'll have to reschedule it.

80
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,792
- Yeah, because we're going to visit Santa Claus.
- What are we going to do?

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,551
- I'm going to be Santa's helper.
- He can win a Santa suit.

82
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,150
- I don't want to.
- You could use a little time on that.

83
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,354
So, did you have a good weekend?

84
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,996
My dad went to the Christmas lunch,
so he's been sick.

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,873
My mom was too.

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,755
- Oskar, did you have a good weekend?
- It was okay.

87
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,794
But Josefine has been with
Jesus the whole weekend.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,797
Oh yeah.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,719
You said yourself
that your boyfriend is called Jesus.

90
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,354
- How embarrassing.
- I don't have a boyfriend.

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,597
She is allowed to
keep that to herself.

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,713
- Are you boyfriend with the real Jesus?
- You can't be.

93
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,472
There are actually some Christians
who devote their lives to Jesus.

94
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,559
- That's like having a boyfriend.
- Have you devoted your life to Jesus?

95
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,389
- I taught him to walk on water.
- Sure.

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,879
Now you stop arguing.
We also need to move on.

97
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,676
Oskar and Josefine. We're doing
the flight from Bethlehem again.

98
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,796
Can you hold hands? Then we need
the Roman soldiers ready here.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,275
Where are the others? There they are.

100
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,713
- Do we have to hold hands?
- It's part of the play.

101
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,354
Just do it now, Oskar.

102
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,076
(whistle)

103
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,032
Hi, Oskar.
How about babysitting Lukas?

104
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,277
- Are you going over to your girlfriend?
- I don't have a girlfriend.

105
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,358
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

106
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,917
- I have an appointment.
- I'm going over to Emilie in an hour.

107
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,873
- Emilie?
- Yeah. She's actually okay.

108
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,108
- I'm in a hurry. See you, Lukas.
- No! Hey, you can't do that!

109
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,959
I'm going to Santa
and be Santa's helper.

110
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,711
- Won't you help change the hay?
- No, I won't.

111
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,837
- Argh.
- No.

112
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,519
Try looking at the goats. Try looking.

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,350
(doorbell)

114
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,194
- Hi. I'm a bit busy today.
- I have to help with the glitter pictures.

115
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,077
Yes, but not if it's a sour duty,
only if it's a pleasure for you.

116
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,395
Is something wrong?

117
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,355
It's a friend who promised me to do
something, which he then didn't do.

118
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,839
I've told you,
that friends, you can't rely on them.

119
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,996
Is it Oskar?

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,393
If it's something that you think
you really have a right to, -

121
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,556
- then you should demand your right.

122
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,716
Sure.

123
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,314
(chimes)

124
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,789
- Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,913
I don't want to prevent people from
celebrating my birthday.

126
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,510
- I want to be celebrated the same day as you.
— Do you mean that?

127
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,673
Then I'm afraid we two don't
have more to talk about. Goodbye.

128
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,077
- No no. Where are you going?
- Home.

129
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,030
- You mustn't.
— Why?

130
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,834
I've missed you.

131
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,792
Well
a

132
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,031
- Are you almost done?
- Almost.

133
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,519
You dare come back after yesterday?
Tell me once, Josefine.

134
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,350
That land far to the north,
where is it actually?

135
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,120
It lies pretty far to the north.

136
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,636
Aha.

137
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,308
And your father,
how many camels does he have?

138
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,476
He has a bicycle.

139
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,593
A bicycle? How many camels
can you get for one like that?

140
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,238
What is she doing here? I don't want to see
her here in Nazareth. She must go. Now.

141
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,910
- You don't decide who I see.
— Yeah.

142
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,076
Jesus.

143
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,510
Come.

144
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,840
Your mother apparently doesn't like me.

145
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,796
I do.

146
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,877
There's something I really want to say.

147
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,354
Your eyes behind the veil are like doves.

148
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,996
Your hair is like a flock of goats,
flowing down the mountain.

149
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,875
- Flock of goats?
- Your lips are like a scarlet thread.

150
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,116
Your mouth is lovely.

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,276
No one has ever said
anything like that to me before.

152
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,948
Is it okay that I said it then?

153
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,549
It's okay.

154
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,033
- What is it?
— A heart.

155
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,316
(mobile phone rings)

156
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,751
- That sound is coming from you.
- Wait a minute.

157
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,637
- Oskar, I don't have time now.
- Lukas is gone.

158
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,389
I was getting something,
and when I got back, he was gone.

159
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,673
- Didn't he say what he was doing?
- He was going to visit Santa Claus.

160
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,836
I know where he is.

161
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,191
- What is that thing?
- It's nothing.

162
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,994
- Who are you talking to?
- Someone I know.

163
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,671
- Is it maybe Jesus?
- Oskar, I'm coming right away.

164
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,031
- So I have to go.
- Did the thing say you had to?

165
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,595
Aren't you coming back then?

166
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,756
Yeah yeah.

167
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,836
- Ho ho ho!
- Yeah, ho ho ho.

168
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,715
It's great
that you became Santa's helper.

169
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,117
But it's stupid to run off
without saying anything.

170
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,676
- Do you want a pepper nut, Josefine?
- No thanks.

171
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,633
- Where does that Jesus live?
- Far from here.

172
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,274
- Do you know Jesus?
— Yes.

173
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,189
- That can't be done.
- I've found a time machine.

174
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,710
- Can I come along?
- It's something she's making up.

175
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,037
- Yeah, that's what we'll say.
- Yeah, that's what we'll say.

176
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,196
Oops, Oskar got mad.

177
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,795
Ho ho ho.

178
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,238
Won't it be good?
You eat heart bread on December 8th.

179
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,352
Yeah, it'll probably be fine enough.

180
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,395
- What is Lukas actually saying?
- What does Lukas say?

181
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,036
- That you've got a girlfriend.
- I don't.

182
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,471
- It's Jesus.
- Just shut up, Lukas.

183
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,037
- Jesus?
- Josefine actually has a time machine.

184
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,473
So you travel back and forth in time
from Denmark to Bethlehem?

185
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,276
- Nazareth.
- Nazareth, of course. That's obvious.

186
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,190
He's okay, isn't he.

187
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,838
So that's why you always look in the Bible.
Before, you couldn't stand Jesus.

188
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,555
- I actually can now.
- Hi. What are you talking about?

189
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,594
- Wow!
- Santa, you look so nice.

190
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,920
Josefine has got a time machine,
that she travels back in time with.

191
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,556
- Oh, darn.
- And she's become Jesus's girlfriend.

192
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,832
— We're not boyfriend and girlfriend.
- They're good friends.

193
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,511
- Don't pay attention to him.
- I just found out myself.

194
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,836
- Can I come along?
- No.

195
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,874
Santa's helper should come along,
when you travel back in time.

196
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,629
We can all just come along,
right?

197
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,071
- No, sorry, Josefine.
- It's okay.

198
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,556
I'm traveling back in time.
Hi, Jesus. Spruce in the hair.

199
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,070
I'll put spruce in your hair,
I will.

200
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,629
Dear God,
or whoever is out there.

201
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,631
It doesn't matter if I can't
have my birthday to myself.

202
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,957
Something much bigger has happened.

203
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,272
Jesus, he has fallen in love with me.
And I am also in love with him.

204
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,792
- I am also in love with Jesus.
- Lukas, be quiet.

205
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,034
I pray to be allowed to be
alone with him again tomorrow. Amen.
