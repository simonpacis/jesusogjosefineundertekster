1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,672
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,395
In Nazareth, Joseph and Mary
are looking for Jesus.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,238
Good morning.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,513
They don't know he's traveled 2,000 years
forward in time to present-day Denmark.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,870
The baker called it a filone bread.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,550
At Josefine's
Jesus blesses the bread.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,311
If you think it's going to
taste better, you're most welcome.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,876
Blessed are you, Lord,
our God …

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,232
He tells them
that his real father is God.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,318
Do you really believe you're God's son?

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,389
Before Jesus goes home to Nazareth,
they will say goodbye to Oskar.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,398
Oskar is sad.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,398
Josefine-Dego is dead,

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,354
Josefine gets Jesus to
bring it back to life.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,350
Josefine-Dego, open your eyes.
I beg you in God's name.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,752
In Nazareth, Joseph gets a visit from
the Roman centurion.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,157
He wants Joseph to
repair a wooden chest.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,033
I don't have any more wood.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,360
The manger. That's excellent wood.
We'll just use that.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,076
Joseph decides
to use the wood from the manger.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,229
At Thorsen's, Jesus discovers
that the nativity scene isn't working.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,670
It's Thorsen who did it.

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,429
- Can't I go home?
— We'll figure out how.

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,469
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,798
laid in the earth like flower seeds

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,120
shoots and sprouts and winds around

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,551
she understands nothing at all

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,158
hours feel like days

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,749
and weeks a thousand years

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,996
came to look back

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,950
to a world of yesterday

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,431
Jesus and Josefine

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,111
homeless heartache

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,872
Jesus gets Josefine

35
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,197
to believe in miracles

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,231
when she wavers

37
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,430
Jesus and Josefine

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,077
faithless time machine

39
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,115
the tempter's concubine

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,156
she needs miracles
also for love

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,920
when she wavers

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,238
- Where is Jesus?
- That's a very authentic recipe.

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,955
- How much flour do you use?
- Just what's needed.

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,630
That's the kind of recipe
I can understand.

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,594
Jesus is teaching me to bake flatbread
like in the old days of Jesus.

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,678
That goes in my cookbook.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,712
No! You mustn't put it on the
hotplate. You need a pan.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,472
My mother
always puts it on the stone oven.

49
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,511
Come.

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,831
Jesus …… How do your parents feel about
you calling yourself Jesus?

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,273
- It's them who call him that.
- No, an angel gave me the name.

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,074
- Can I meet your parents?
- No.

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,513
- Now I'm talking to Jesus.
- There was something you were going to show me.

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,548
Josefine. We need to
talk about this.

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,876
- What are we going to talk about?
- Your friend Jesus.

56
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,551
He's a nice guy and really sweet,
but he's not right in the head.

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,550
It doesn't help to support
him in that. He needs help.

58
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,991
- I am helping him.
- It smells so good here.

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,478
You know what? I asked Jesus...
No flour on the priest's robe.

60
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,956
Jesus wants to come to church.

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,517
That's the right place for a boy
who thinks he is called Jesus.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,157
Jesper, Jesus can't help it
that he has special powers.

63
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,960
Special powers?

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,879
The boy is raving mad.

65
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,993
He's trying to
teach Lukas to walk on water.

66
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,998
Are you taking him to the service?

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,078
What if your mom says,
he ends up on the cross?

68
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,909
Who says he ends up on that cross?
Maybe we can prevent it.

69
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,639
- We're not getting involved. Jesus needs to go home.
- He will. Just relax.

70
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,952
- I just need to figure out how.
- I went so far, and then I fell in.

71
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,954
(the organ plays)

72
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,035
- Now my mom is going up to preach.
- Why aren't there more people here?

73
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,553
- Because it's only Sunday.
- The synagogue is always full.

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,239
At Christmas it's packed here.

75
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,197
Christmas is the time of the heart.
We cozy up in the glow of the Advent candle.

76
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,874
But we must not forget that when Jesus
was born in a stable in Bethlehem, -

77
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,279
- there was no peace in the world.
Just like there is no peace in our time.

78
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,359
I was reminded of that yesterday,
when my daughter's friend wisely said:

79
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,998
There is always strife on Earth,
only in Heaven is there peace.

80
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,670
That is the hope Jesus gives us
with his birth... and with his death.

81
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,514
But we must not close our eyes
and just wait to get to Heaven.

82
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,989
For Jesus was not afraid
to walk on earth, even though it burned.

83
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,192
Yes. And he's sitting right here.

84
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,233
Honestly, shouldn't we go?

85
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,592
You! Son of Man.

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,590
Your father wants you back,
but the manger is gone.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,629
"The manger is gone."
What if I never get home?

88
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,990
We'll get you home.

89
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,351
Even though the manger is gone,
it should still work.

90
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,633
- Then you just come out another way.
- What if it's broken?

91
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,719
- What do you mean?
- If the Romans destroyed our house.

92
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,393
If only we could call and ask.

93
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,354
- We can.
- Don't you have your mobile?

94
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,348
- Simon and Judas have it.
- Why didn't you say so earlier?

95
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,279
Are Simon and Judas your friends?

96
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,836
(mobile rings)

97
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,959
No, it's there. Let me just.

98
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,869
- It's Judas.
- Hi, Judas. It's Josefine.

99
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,119
- Hi. Where is Jesus?
- Right here. Try saying hi.

100
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,677
- Hi.
- Ask if he's coming home soon.

101
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,997
- Are you coming home soon?
- I hope so.

102
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,829
Go into the stable
and look for an old manger.

103
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,076
That's the one from Bethlehem.

104
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,637
- Why do we have to do that?
- Just do it now, and call back.

105
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,710
- How do you call back?
- Press the green button three times.

106
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,876
Bye bye.

107
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,550
So let's cross our fingers. We have to get
down to Thorsen before he closes.

108
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,038
- What's happening at Thorsen's?
- Nothing. You need to go home now.

109
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,437
I'm hurrying back.

110
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,437
Come on, Lukas.

111
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,752
That's really a keepsake
worth taking with you.

112
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,997
You'll have to pay a little extra.

113
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,590
I got scolded by my wife
for working on the Sabbath.

114
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,430
I had to hide
that I used wood from my son's manger.

115
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,438
I'll gladly pay extra for the wood -

116
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,474
- from the boy
with fire out of the finger's manger.

117
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,229
And don't say
that a Roman never pays his debt.

118
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,436
- Have they called?
- No, not yet.

119
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,995
(phone rings)

120
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,393
- It's Jesus.
- Your dad used the manger for a lid.

121
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,435
- He sold it to the Romans.
- Then I can't come home.

122
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,794
- Hello? Why is the manger so important?
- Because I need it.

123
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,879
You'll have to get the manger
and put it back in the stable.

124
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,958
We can't get it from the Romans.

125
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,119
- Can't you throw a stink bomb?
- What's that?

126
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,154
Throw something that smells bad.
Then you clear the joint.

127
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,797
- Then you grab the lid meanwhile.
- But it's dangerous.

128
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,309
It's an order from God.

129
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,956
Jesus says
it's a direct order from God.

130
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,469
Call when you've done it.

131
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,470
Remember those fish my dad
brought? They've started rotting.

132
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,238
Hurry up.

133
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,352
Wha' …

134
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,313
Ugh, what a stench!

135
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,675
Can you get rid of that smell!
I'm trying to pack something.

136
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,394
Fools! Imbeciles!

137
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,712
This is an outrage against
the entire Roman Empire.

138
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,277
How could you let it pass
without intervening?

139
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,270
It's the kind of uprising
we're here to crush!

140
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,077
And you let yourselves get taken in by
some rotten fish.

141
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,472
- But, centurion …
- I don't want to hear any more excuses!

142
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,231
Get those fish removed!
And go take a bath.

143
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,592
Damn terror attacks.
Good thing I'm going home.

144
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,597
- It fits really well.
- Tell me, what are you doing?

145
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,591
- We're putting the manger together.
- But I just sold it.

146
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,954
- What did you just sell?
- He destroyed Jesus' manger.

147
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,551
- But now we've made it.
- What do you have?

148
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,630
- I got good money for it.
- It's my last memory of Jesus.

149
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,436
How nicely you've made it, boys.
Put it in the stable, Judas.

150
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,553
Joseph, you're coming with me right now.
We have something to talk about. Now!

151
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,477
It's Simon. The manger is repaired,
Judas is putting it in the stable.

152
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,116
Fine, Simon. See you.

153
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,036
- That's it. Now I can go home.
- Then we just need to go down to Thorsen.

154
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,994
You have to remember your tunic …
and your sandals.

155
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,073
Josefine, there's something
I want to ask you about.

156
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,432
Down in the church
your mother said something about my death.

157
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,198
Yes,

158
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,598
- What's with my death?
- There's nothing.

159
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,191
- But how do I die?
- Like an ordinary old man.

160
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,951
(there's a knock on the door)

161
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,359
- Hello. Is that you, Jesus?
- Uh … yes. Jesus of Nazareth.

162
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,279
Your parents are away traveling?

163
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,234
- Nah, I think they're home.
- Come with us. We need to talk to you.

164
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,874
- You can't do that.
- What?

165
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,310
It's okay, Josefine.

166
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,348
I've written the history of flatbread
into my baking book.

167
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,078
- Jesus has been taken by the police!
- It was me who called them.

168
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,273
- Is he going to jail?
- No, now social services will take over.

169
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,869
Why did you do it?

170
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,993
The boy thinks he's Jesus
and doesn't know where he lives.

171
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,715
His parents are away traveling.
That's irresponsible.

172
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,038
- The authorities need to know.
- He was on his way home to his parents.

173
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,800
You've ruined everything.

174
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,438
Dear God, you must save Jesus, -

175
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,554
- so he doesn't go to jail
or to an orphanage.

176
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,595
And I'm also praying that the nativity play
works, so he can come home.

177
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,395
- What nativity play?
- Lie down and sleep.

178
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,354
- Where is Thorsen's shop?
- Nowhere. Sleep!

179
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,399
Now I just hope
no more accidents happen. Amen.
