1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,270
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,474
Okay. Down in Thorsen's shop
Josefine has found a magical nativity game.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,119
With the help of the nativity game, she can
travel to Nazareth 2,000 years ago.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,915
Here she meets Jesus,
when he is her age.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,156
It's Sabbath, the day of rest.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,990
It sticks in the throat
and tastes disgusting. Yuck.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,512
Josefine wants him to
ban rice pudding.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,553
While they talk,
Josefine's mobile rings.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,796
- Hello?
- It's Oskar.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,355
- Where are you?
- I'll call later.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,996
- A blind beggar approaches Jesus.
— Jesus.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,034
It's Joshua,
King Herod's old high priest.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,276
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,117
In God's name,
I restore your sight.

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,396
Joshua wants to go out and tell
that the Son of God is among them.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,512
His name is Jesus. He's okay.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,271
When Josefine returns,
she meets Oskar.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,836
- He wants to know if she has another.
— No.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,910
At home, Josefine discovers that according to
the Bible, it's wrong to eat rice pudding.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,271
- Aren't we having rice pudding?
- Now you mind yourself.

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,074
Remember, this is a priest's home.

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,628
Josefine prays that Jesus moves
his birthday so she can have hers in peace.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,199
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,393
laid in the soil like flower seeds

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,833
shoots and sprouts and winds around

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,716
she understands nothing at all

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,674
hours feel like days

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,954
and weeks a thousand years

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,075
came to look back

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,034
to a world of yesterday

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,268
Jesus and Josefine

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,678
homeless heartache

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,079
but Jesus gets Josefine

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,750
to believe in miracles

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,713
when she wavers

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,630
Jesus and Josefine

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,277
faithless time machine

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,032
tempter's concubine

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,633
she needs miracles
and love

40
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,355
when she wavers

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,516
(organ music)

42
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,240
- Why doesn't anyone have elf hats on?
- Because only stupid kids believe in elves.

43
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,670
Shh. Mom is very nervous.

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,829
There's nothing to be
nervous about, there's no one here.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,356
Let us all pray,

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,836
- Elf hats, elf hats …
- Shh.

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,192
When we read today's gospel
about the adult Jesus, -

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,790
- who tells about God's kingdom, -

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,039
- we meet a man
who knows what he wants.

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,509
If we leaf back in the Bible,
we meet a somewhat different Jesus.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,549
The 12-year-old Jesus knew,
that he was extraordinary.

52
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,878
His mother had told him that.

53
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,269
But he didn't quite believe it.
He hid his light under a bushel.

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,268
Then a girl came
from a country to the North.

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,109
He didn't know her.
He didn't know who she was.

56
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,754
- Where are you from?
- A country far to the North.

57
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,599
Farther away than Rome?

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,270
But Jesus trusted her, -

59
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,517
- and the girl from the North
helped him to believe, -

60
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,238
- so he restored sight to a blind man,
and on a Sabbath.

61
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,954
- Did Jesus wear an elf hat?
- Shh.

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,279
So even though Jesus was God's son,
he was also a human.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,949
And he wasn't too proud
to accept help -

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,631
- from a perfectly ordinary girl
from the North.

65
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,756
Hi.

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,353
If I don't get better,
I can't fill the church on Christmas Eve.

67
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,509
- Believe in yourself.
- No, not flour on the priest's robe.

68
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,758
That girl from the North,
who was she really?

69
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,550
- Is that my daughter there?
- Yes yes, I definitely think so.

70
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,190
Who doesn't know the girl from the North.
You learned about her in kindergarten.

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,949
I can't remember all
the Bible stories. You can't at all.

72
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,075
Oh well, but anyway, just the girl from the North.
Everyone remembers her, don't they?

73
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,796
I was crazy about her as a kid.
You know the girl from the North, right?

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,912
- What was her name?
- I don't really know.

75
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,113
- Does the Bible say anything about it?
- She was just someone who helped Jesus.

76
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,677
- Maybe she was an angel.
- She was an ordinary girl.

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,269
I believe she was an angel.

78
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,396
How wild.

79
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,956
Yeah, the Bible is
actually pretty wild.

80
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,472
We also need to come up with a name for
the buns. What should we call them?

81
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,752
- Girl from the North buns?
- Okay.

82
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,716
(doorbell)

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,869
- Thorsen?
- Hi there. How nice to see you.

84
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,552
- Are you open on Sundays?
- No, I work when I feel like it.

85
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,356
Not that I feel like it now,
but this box arrived this morning.

86
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,233
- They're nice.
- Do you collect glitter cards?

87
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,237
Couldn't you help me
sort these?

88
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,831
We could do it by putting
all animals in one folder, -

89
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,433
- and people in another, and postcards
could go in a third folder, and …

90
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,351
And everything that just smells
of Christmas … that goes out.

91
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,996
- Is there any with the girl from the North on?
- The girl from the North?

92
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,829
Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,635
What do you say to this one?
She's beautiful.

94
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,318
- She's an angel.
- Yeah, wasn't she?

95
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,353
That's what they say anyway.
She helped Jesus.

96
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,437
If only she had helped him
forbid people from celebrating Christmas.

97
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,589
Now I'll help myself
by fixing my motorcycle. See you.

98
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,796
(chimes)

99
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,480
- The balls aren't rolling right for you.
- Relax, I'll beat you.

100
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,476
Hi, Jesus.

101
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,794
- Josefine, good to see you.
- I've got the girl from Nord-boller with me.

102
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,110
They look good.

103
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,279
- What about your game, Jesus?
- Can't it wait until later?

104
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,795
If it's your turn, you can win.

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,788
- It's me and Jesus playing.
- Come on, Simon.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,275
- Where are you two going?
- We have an appointment.

107
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,080
- Your dad is good at baking.
- I can ask him to make some more.

108
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,840
But then you have to do me a favor.

109
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,391
- You have to abolish Christmas Eve.
- What is Christmas Eve?

110
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,673
An evening we observe in my country,
where we celebrate your birthday.

111
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,917
- How do you know?
- It's the same day as mine.

112
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,908
- When is it?
- In 17 days.

113
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,716
Can't you give a speech
where you say you don't want to be celebrated?

114
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,119
- I'm tired of sharing with others.
- We share your dad's buns equally.

115
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,039
Yes, that's quite right, of course.

116
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,754
If you give that speech,
then I will …

117
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,158
- Teach you to walk on water.
- Nobody can do that.

118
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,510
You can. Come.

119
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,912
- I can't.
- You just have to believe you can.

120
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,159
- How?
- Put one foot in front of the other and walk.

121
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,555
- Then walk.
- Can you walk on water?

122
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,399
- No.
- Why not?

123
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,594
- Because I don't believe I can.
- Then I don't believe I can either.

124
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,470
My sandal! What are you doing?

125
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,035
Go get it.

126
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,997
- Do you believe in me now?
- I believe in you.

127
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,637
(thunder)
Don't worry, I believe in you most of all, God.

128
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,110
- Have you seen Jesus?
- Nah.

129
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,269
- He said he was going to help you.
- I haven't noticed much of that.

130
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,275
Simon, Judas, come here,

131
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,395
- Have you seen Jesus?
- No.

132
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,118
You're lying.
I can see it on you, Simon.

133
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,872
Maria, that doesn't help at all.
It takes completely different measures.

134
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,437
Boys, listen up, you'll get a coin
if you tell me where Jesus is.

135
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,074
- He…
- We haven't seen him.

136
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,317
That's fine. Just run along.

137
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,716
Worth a try.

138
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,550
- Uh, sorry.
- Yes? What is it, Judas?

139
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,958
I just want to say Jesus is walking
around on the water with that girl.

140
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,754
- What?
- On the water?

141
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,675
- I'll get you a coin.
- What are you telling me?

142
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,872
- Nothing.
- You stay here.

143
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,993
- So where have you been?
- Josefine has heard me on the Ten Commandments.

144
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,159
Aha, so can you tell me
the eighth commandment?

145
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,232
Jesus?

146
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,513
You shall not lie. Judas saw you walking around down by the river.

147
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,474
I didn't tattle.
I didn't.

148
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,559
- Here, you honestly earned this.
- Tattletale.

149
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,799
I don't want you using
your divine powers on nonsense.

150
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,312
- I don't want that.
- Remember about the birthday, okay?

151
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,991
And I don't want to see you here again.
Can you get lost.

152
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,475
Get lost, I said.

153
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,353
Pst. In with you.

154
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,029
Scram then. When Maria is in that mood,
she's not to be trifled with.

155
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,156
- How's it going with the glitter pictures?
- Fine. I'm just nowhere near done.

156
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,879
I'll be done with the motorcycle before
you're done with the glitter pictures.

157
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,155
In any case, I'll be
done before your birthday on the 24th.

158
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,999
Isn't it Christmas
on my birthday anymore?

159
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,637
Not if you really believe it.
Then you get what you want.

160
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,230
- Has Christmas been abolished?
- Ho, ho, ho.

161
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,194
You know perfectly well
that the word Christmas is forbidden here.

162
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,392
You're probably not the right one to ask.
See you.

163
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,436
Hi.

164
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,712
Can you tell me
what date Christmas Eve is?

165
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,152
- Isn't it the 27th of December?
— Is it?

166
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,911
You're too easy. It's the 24th,
as it always is.

167
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,796
Why's that?

168
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,715
Oh, no reason.

169
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,675
- Okay, what's his name?
- Who?

170
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,553
Yeah, the one you see all the time.

171
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,469
- Who says I'm seeing anyone?
- I do. What's his name?

172
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,911
If you really want to know,
his name is Jesus.

173
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,795
Jesus. Now you need to mind your own business.

174
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,114
Alright, I'm heading home.

175
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,316
(door slams)

176
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,758
This is a German Christmas cake.

177
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,717
When people have read my cookbook,
anyone can just make this cake.

178
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,794
I think it's burnt on the bottom.

179
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,632
No, it looks good, Jesper.
Believe in yourself. Pine needle in your hair.

180
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,277
Hello, Josefine.
We haven't seen much of you today.

181
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,238
- A piece of burnt Christmas cake?
- I'm not hungry.

182
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,673
- Is something wrong?
- I've been cheated.

183
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,388
What happened to the girl from the North?

184
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,195
Some say
that Maria chased her away, -

185
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,119
— because she taught Jesus
to walk on water.

186
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,232
Others believe
she was sold to the Romans -

187
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,238
- and ended her days
as a slave in Rome.

188
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,079
- A slave?
- It's just a good story.

189
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,799
- I actually think that one's true enough.
- There are so many colorful stories,

190
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,830
Dear God, or whoever you are.

191
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,398
Jesus, he actually promised me
to move his birthday.

192
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,673
Let me come down, so I can
sort this all out once and for all.

193
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,509
Yeah, and I'd rather not end up
as a slave in Rome.

194
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,759
- Want some rum?
- Relax, Lukas.

195
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,838
I don't think the world has heard
the last of the girl from the North.
