1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,393
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,997
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,191
Okay.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,916
Down in Thorsen's shop, Josefine
has found a magical nativity game.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,674
With the help of the nativity game, she can
travel to Nazareth 2,000 years ago.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,759
Here she meets Jesus,
when he is her age.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,951
My name is Josefine.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,756
She wants to tell Oskar about it,
but he doesn't want to talk to her.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,157
He's still upset,
because she doesn't want to go steady.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,269
After school, Josefine travels
to Nazareth.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,473
She beats him at Kalaha and teaches him
that "okay" means "alright".

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,949
Jesus asks where she's from.
Josefine says she comes from the north.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,674
Farther away than Rome?

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,713
Jesus and Josefine become good friends.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,638
Jesus tells that he has
a dream of becoming a gladiator.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,076
- Can you do me a favor?
- Jesus turns a jug of water into wine.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,271
It's just for me and the friends.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,996
Josefine teaches Jesus
to turn a jug of water into apple juice.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,871
When Josefine comes home, she discovers
that people don't drink elf beer anymore.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,993
Instead, people drink apple juice,
which is now called Nazareth juice.

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,712
In Josefine's head
a plan begins to take shape.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,560
And in her evening prayer, she asks God
to make the rice pudding disappear.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,435
Lukas, I think you've eaten
your last portion of rice pudding.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,392
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,070
laid in the soil like flower seeds

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,559
shoots and sprouts and winds around

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,197
she understands nothing at all

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,313
hours feel like days

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,876
and weeks a thousand years

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,914
came to look back

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,874
to a world of yesterday

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,995
Jesus and Josefine

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,478
homeless heartache

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,879
but Jesus gets Josefine

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,390
to believe in miracles

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,478
when she wavers

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,356
Jesus and Josefine

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,031
faithless time machine

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,950
tempter's concubine

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,037
she needs miracles

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,193
when she wavers

42
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,076
That doesn't look like you to read the Bible.

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,875
I need to see where Jesus drinks juice.
That's a bit wild.

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,310
That's not the wildest in the Bible.

45
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,231
- He drank the same as me.
- Yes, and he made the blind see.

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,752
I could use some of that
divine help for my back.

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,598
There's only Christmas decorations in there.

48
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,634
- There there, dad. Pine needles in your hair.
- Take good care of that back.

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,037
— Shall we make a snowscape?
- I have an appointment.

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,038
- With whom?
- With no one.

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,835
- We don't need to get involved in that.
- I'm not getting involved.

52
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,439
- It's about Oskar, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,794
- So we'll see each other for the rice pudding.
- What? You can still have pizza.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,834
No, I think it's cool,
that we eat the same thing.

55
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,715
(doorbell rings)

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,594
Hey, Josefine, come here.

57
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,790
Now you're going to see something
really exciting.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,831
Are you ready?

59
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,349
There.

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,758
What do you say to that? It just needs
a little life blown into it.

61
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,110
Then that motorcycle will roll for sure.

62
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,278
My dad tried to
fix one like that too.

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,391
He gave up.

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,398
You might as well learn
that right away.

65
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,718
If you want something badly enough,
then it will succeed.

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,992
You have to believe in yourself.

67
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,555
This bike, you know, -

68
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,753
- it reminds me so much of one
I rode when I was young.

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,791
When I was a wild angel.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,390
Today I would
have been called a rocker.

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,958
- Are you a rocker?
- I was. A real tough guy, you know.

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,199
Don't you believe me? Okay.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,351
Then take a look at this. Are you ready?

74
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,632
- What do you say to that?
- Okay.

75
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,152
Now I have such a desire to
get out and get the blood pumping again.

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,909
And it's the desire
that drives the work, right?

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,072
I mostly want to
wander around and look a bit.

78
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,070
You control that desire yourself. But if you
break something, it costs a krone.

79
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,956
And if you think about Christmas in the meantime,
it costs two kroner.

80
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,828
(sighs)

81
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,996
(chimes start)

82
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,398
- Hi, Jesus.
- Shh, my mother and Joseph are sleeping.

83
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,830
- What are you doing?
- I was just passing by.

84
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,272
- Why aren't you with your family?
- I'd rather visit you.

85
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,391
It's a day of rest. Sabbath.

86
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,149
We don't keep the Sabbath at our house.
Just the weekend.

87
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,592
- Don't you belong to God's people then?
- My mom is a priest, at least.

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,075
- Is your mom a priest?
- Is that so strange?

89
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,795
My mom would also be a good priest.
She has me practicing the commandments.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,754
- The commandments?
- God's laws, that Moses got on the mountain.

91
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,997
Isn't it: "You shall not steal"?

92
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,509
"You shall have no other gods."
"Do not misuse God's name."

93
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,951
"Keep the Sabbath holy."
"Honor your father and your mother."

94
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,118
That was five of them.
You get really hungry.

95
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,436
- Me too.
- Just a moment.

96
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,030
Are you almost done?

97
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,357
Don't disturb me now.
I have to write that sermon.

98
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,120
Are you going to wear an elf hat?

99
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,198
In church? No, I don't think so.

100
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,992
(knock on the door)

101
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,239
Hi, Oskar. Will you help me make
a snow landscape?

102
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,877
— Not right now. Is Josefine home?
- I think she had an appointment.

103
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,393
- Isn't she at your place?
- At my place? I just got home.

104
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,194
Have you tried calling her?

105
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,755
(mobile phone rings)

106
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,717
How wild.

107
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,077
- Hello?
- It's Oskar.

108
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,397
- Can't I call a bit later?
- Where are you?

109
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,397
Bye bye, see you.

110
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,831
(busy signal)

111
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,077
- Did you hear a weird sound too?
- Nah.

112
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
Well, then it was probably nothing.

113
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,513
Blessed are you, Lord, our God, -

114
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,792
- King of the universe,
who brings forth bread from the earth.

115
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,676
Apple juice?

116
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,153
It's better than what my dad makes.
It reminds me a bit of pizza.

117
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,555
Pizza?

118
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,715
Those round things,
where you put cheese and meat on.

119
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,029
- Isn't cheese made from milk?
- Yes, why?

120
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,152
We must not mix milk and meat.
Can you?

121
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,796
We have a thing
that should be banned. Rice pudding.

122
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,879
- What is rice pudding?
- It's rice boiled in milk.

123
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,675
- And then sprinkled with cinnamon.
- I like cinnamon.

124
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,589
That's the porridge.
It sticks in your throat.

125
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,112
- And it tastes disgusting.
- Okay, I get it.

126
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,313
When you grow up, will you promise me
to ban the rice pudding?

127
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,910
I don't want to
meddle in what people eat.

128
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,438
If you don't promise
to ban the rice pudding, -

129
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,428
- I'm afraid
that I can't visit you again.

130
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,953
Then I swear to ban rice pudding,
if I become a great prophet.

131
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,875
- Jesus?
- Who's that?

132
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,915
Jesus?

133
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,388
jesus!

134
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,034
It's me.

135
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,915
Lord, forgive me. My name is Joshua.

136
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,398
I was once high priest
with old King Herod.

137
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,230
- The one who tried to kill me?
- I tried to prevent it.

138
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,479
I've searched for you everywhere
in Galilee and Judea.

139
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,312
Try to help him.
Give him back his sight.

140
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,034
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

141
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,997
- It's probably forbidden on a Sabbath.
- It doesn't matter what day it is.

142
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,634
- I don't even know how to do it.
- Try.

143
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,916
In God's name.
I give you back your sight.

144
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,873
So, that's what you look like. Son of God.

145
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,276
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.

146
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,789
I will go out into the world and tell, -

147
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,470
- that the Son of God is among us.

148
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,797
I think you should only
thank God, okay?

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,117
I don't know the word "okay".

150
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,199
But I'm sure
that it's a divine word.

151
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,871
I've got my sight back. Okay.

152
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,993
The son of God is among us. Okay.

153
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,035
His name is Jesus. He's okay.

154
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,470
What's that noise, Jesus?

155
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,195
Jesus has given me my sight back.

156
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,709
- He's the son of God.
- What are you doing …

157
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,797
Are you out of your mind?

158
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,198
If mom finds out you're doing something like that
on a sabbath, she'll be furious.

159
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,075
Shall we just agree
not to say anything to her?

160
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,992
You know what? It's fine.
Just make a jug like that.

161
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,998
Joseph?

162
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,515
What's this? Are you tempting him
to turn water into wine?

163
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,280
I just felt like having a jug.

164
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,313
I don't want
him using his powers on nonsense.

165
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,548
That's no worse than giving
the blind their sight back on a sabbath.

166
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,149
You shall keep the sabbath holy.

167
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,158
It doesn't matter
what day it is.

168
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,555
Say something to him.

169
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,197
No, I'm about to give up.
Lord, forgive us.

170
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,118
(doorbell rings)

171
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,031
Hey, Oskar.

172
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,877
- Is Josefine here?
- No, I haven't seen her.

173
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,435
Oh, there she is.

174
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,233
- Where were you when I rang?
- Nowhere.

175
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,629
- Are you dating someone else?
- No.

176
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,510
- Are you seeing someone else?
- No.

177
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,990
There's no one in there.

178
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,637
(door slams)

179
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,395
- He's still upset, I guess.
- Yeah.

180
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,637
But remember: Friendship isn't
the most important thing in life.

181
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,559
So what's the most important?

182
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,718
It's that the spark plugs work.

183
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,593
(motorcycle roars)

184
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,832
What do you say now?!

185
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,116
(motorcycle stalls)

186
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,197
Oops.

187
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,316
- Hi.
- Hi. I never thought you'd come.

188
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,954
- Hi, Josefine.
- Hi, mom.

189
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,630
- Did you have a good day?
- Yeah, it was okay.

190
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,798
- I was over at Oskar's.
- At Oskar's?

191
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,356
He was just here.
He's called a few times too.

192
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,633
- That's weird, since you've been together.
- Yeah, it sounds strange.

193
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,719
You should also be allowed to
have your little secrets.

194
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,038
- Then there's Christmas pizza.
- Yes! I love Christmas pizza.

195
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,670
Weren't we supposed to have rice pudding?

196
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,872
- Now you behave.
- Ugh, how gross.

197
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,072
Remember, this is a priest's home.

198
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,159
- What's wrong with rice pudding?
- You know very well.

199
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,794
It's not because it's forbidden, -

200
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,118
- but Jesus said
it was bad to mix rice and milk.

201
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,358
It's the porridge.
It sticks in my throat.

202
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,274
Then I swear to ban rice porridge.

203
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,837
It's better than what my dad makes.
It reminds me a bit of pizza.

204
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,431
Those round things,
where you put cheese and meat on.

205
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,437
There you go.
I love Christmas pizza.

206
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,549
Dear God, or whoever
is up there.

207
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,354
Thanks for another wild day.

208
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,189
That was sweet of Jesus,
he wanted to abolish rice porridge.

209
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,678
- Who's sweet?
- No one. Turn around and sleep.

210
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,318
So I hope I can come by
and visit Jesus again tomorrow.

211
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,469
If only he'd move his birthday,
so I can keep mine to myself.

212
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,557
Amen.
