1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,997
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,555
Okay.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,833
Oskar has been taken prisoner.
The Romans want to send him to the galleys.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,478
When the sun is at its zenith, and there are no
more shadows on that pillar there, -

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,875
- we ship you off to the galleys.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,676
Armed with Thorsen's pruning shears,
Josefine heads to Nazareth.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,078
Simon and Judas lure the Romans away
with the help of Jesper's buns.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,434
- We're opening a bakery here in Nazareth.
- Would you like to taste our Nazareth buns?

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,791
Your Nazareth buns
are hereby confiscated.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,391
- Shouldn't you catch them first?
- What? Come back!

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,269
Josefine and Jesus free Oskar
with the pruning shears.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,155
- The Romans' centurion surprises them.
— You stay here.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,558
Freeing a rebel we consider
a great crime.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,432
Run!

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,272
But when he sees Jesus make fire,
he falls to his knees and surrenders.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,076
- Oskar greets Josef.
- Hi in the shed. You didn't know that one.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,637
- And gives Jesus his mobile as thanks.
- A thousand thanks.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,150
Oskar asks Josefine
not to change the past.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,557
- Can't you see it's dangerous?
- It's too dangerous.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,228
— Not really dangerous.
- Grotesquely dangerous.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,037
Josefine says she'll try,
but she can't promise it.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,480
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,639
laid in the soil like flower seeds

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,073
they shoot up and sprout and twist around

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,035
she understands nothing at all

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,028
hours feel like days

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,268
and weeks a thousand years

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,429
came to look back

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,394
to a world of yesterday

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,628
Jesus and Josefine

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,913
homeless heartache

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,433
but Jesus gets Josefine

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,996
to believe in miracles

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,033
when she wavers

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,950
Jesus and Josefine

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,631
faithless time machine

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,392
the tempter's concubine

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,913
she needs miracles
and love too

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,795
when she wavers

40
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,876
Josefine,

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,275
Uh.

42
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,268
(motorcycle noise)

43
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,436
Josefine,

44
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,996
Josefine,

45
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,916
Josefine,

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,670
- Josefine?
- Wish me luck at the publisher's.

47
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,668
- Take care of your back now.
- It doesn't weigh much.

48
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,952
- Can't you hear it?
- Hear what?

49
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,278
It's like someone
is calling my name.

50
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,071
— I can't hear anyone.
- I think it's Jesus.

51
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,352
- Why?
- She's been calling for him all night.

52
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,154
Jesus! And now he's coming back.

53
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,989
- That doesn't fit.
- Aren't you inviting Jesus home?

54
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,795
- I'd like to meet him.
- No, forget about that.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,438
What's up with that Jesus? Is it because
he's 17 and a juvenile delinquent?

56
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,518
- What's wrong?
- Weren't you supposed to leave?

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
- Yeah, see you.
- Good luck.

58
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,236
(beep)

59
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,716
Hi.

60
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,513
My parents were just so dim-witted.

61
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,188
Hello?

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,428
That's too wild. We're in the Bible.
I'm the boy from the North.

63
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,589
- Him, whom Jesus set free.
- It was me who got you free.

64
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,157
- You're not going back down there, right?
- Why not?

65
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,038
- You could kill Jesus.
- Why would I kill him?

66
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,756
If the Romans got hold of him
and killed him as a boy.

67
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,351
- So what?
- Then the Bible wouldn't have been written.

68
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,395
- Aren't you exaggerating?
- We have to destroy that nativity play.

69
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,273
It's far too dangerous.

70
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,154
But I want to be allowed to go down to
Jesus one last time and say goodbye.

71
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,032
- What's so funny?
- That I've met the real Joseph.

72
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,435
I know how he should be played.

73
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,233
What kind of little rascal are you?
Dave's in the shed.

74
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,000
I am Joseph of Abraham's lineage.

75
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,274
You know, Abraham, David, Uriah,
Solomon and all the way to me.

76
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,790
Yeah, sorry, I'm interrupting, but…

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,675
- Was that why you were gone yesterday?
- What do you mean?

78
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,398
- To rewrite your roles.
- We think there should be more action.

79
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,070
As long as you don't change the story,
it's fine.

80
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,191
Josefine!

81
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,036
Josefine, come see. There's
a weird guy calling for you.

82
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,996
Josefine!

83
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,953
- He's freezing, he needs to come in the warm.
- One moment.

84
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,629
- Jesus.
- I knew I'd find you.

85
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,912
- Hi, little brother.
- You're not all there.

86
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,398
If this is the land to the North,
then it's cold and strange.

87
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,674
- We'll start by going over to your place.
- We'll go down and send him back.

88
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,270
I don't want to be sent back.
I want to see where you live.

89
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,436
Come.

90
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,474
- I saw boxes rolling with people in them.
- Those are cars.

91
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,034
How far are we from Galilee?

92
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,356
About 2,000 years.

93
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,356
I don't get that.

94
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,950
Jesus, you've come to the future.

95
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,276
Are you from God's kingdom or Satan's?

96
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,233
From Denmark. A completely ordinary country.

97
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,070
- We're not in Hell?
- I'll show you something.

98
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,668
Hey, Jesus. Try this,

99
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,830
My friends need to see me in this.
Thanks, little brother.

100
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,110
I'm not her little brother.
I'm her friend.

101
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,393
- I'm three months older.
- Sorry, I ended up lying.

102
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,556
That's okay.

103
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,274
I forgive you.

104
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,511
So we should probably go down to Thorsen, right?

105
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,757
— We have to stop by the church first.
- The church?

106
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,111
He should at least see
his father's house, right?

107
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,036
(organ music)

108
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,756
Is that God speaking?

109
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,032
That's Poulsen,
who's practicing Christmas hymns,

110
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,755
- And is this God's house?
- Yes, this is God's house.

111
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,396
Oh no, the cross!

112
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,918
- Why is there a crucified man here?
- You'll have to figure this out yourself.

113
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,274
- Sorry.
- I can see who it is.

114
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,032
The man the Romans executed in front of
Nazareth. It looks just like him.

115
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,792
- It shows how malicious they are.
- Yes, exactly.

116
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,595
But now I really want to
go home to Nazareth.

117
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,234
"Closed due to freedom"?

118
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,876
Thorsen.

119
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,071
Thorsen.

120
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,431
Thorsen.
It's right in the middle of opening hours, though.

121
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,949
(motorcycle noise)

122
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,869
- He's roaring around on his motorcycle.
- He's cheeky.

123
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,390
- He's pretty cringy.
- But also quite nice.

124
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,239
So I can't go home at all?

125
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,468
Yes, if you sleep at my place tonight,
we'll get you home tomorrow.

126
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,636
- Okay.
- Come on.

127
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,151
I was about to get into the Guinness
Book of Records with the smallest Christmas heart.

128
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,990
But then my dad opened the window,
and guess what, it blew away.

129
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,158
I want to be in the Guinness Book of Records too.

130
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,672
So it's just about practicing,
and it will surely work out.

131
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,075
- Hi.
- Hi, Josefine.

132
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,759
- Oh, you have guests with you.
— Yes.

133
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,436
My name is Louise,
I'm Josefine's mom.

134
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,390
Uh, this is Jesus.
The one I've talked so much about.

135
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,954
- What's wrong with dad?
- Yeah, he…

136
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,951
They weren't thrilled with the baking book. There
were too many recipes for buns.

137
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,837
So now he's got a bad back.
Jesper, say hi to Jesus.

138
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,034
Oh, so you're Jesus. Hi hi.
We've talked quite a bit about you…

139
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,754
Jesper.

140
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,236
Why doesn't he have
that kind of clothes on?

141
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,878
Well, it's because
Jesus is a smart boy, right?

142
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,835
Mom, can Jesus sleep here tonight?

143
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,036
Jesus forgot his keys,
and his parents are away traveling.

144
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,915
- Yes, of course he can.
- Can you play Kalaha?

145
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,715
Yes, Jesus wants to play
in a bit. Come on.

146
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,032
- Have you seen Jesus today?
- He hasn't been here at all.

147
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,994
I told his mom
that he was probably with you.

148
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,873
He's probably with Josefine.

149
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,235
Could be, if we find him,
we earn a silver coin.

150
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,876
- Judas, you always think about money.
- Boys.

151
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,399
Warn Jesus.

152
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,238
He is in great danger.

153
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,273
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

154
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,155
He is distant from me.

155
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,676
But I hear a strange word.

156
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,798
Ju. JU...

157
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,470
Christmas heart.

158
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,914
- That's a Christmas heart.
- It looks like what you drew in the sand.

159
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,750
Yes, look. Then you can put
candy in it and hang it on the tree.

160
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,679
- What tree?
- The Christmas tree.

161
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,759
- What is a Christmas tree?
- Don't you celebrate Christmas at all, Jesus?

162
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,873
Yes yes, he does.
It's just a different Christmas.

163
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,438
- So without a Christmas tree.
- Is that in South America or Spain?

164
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,075
- In Nazareth.
- I know you live on Nazareth Road.

165
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,229
But you and your family,
where are you from?

166
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,638
Jesus isn't exactly a normal name
around these parts.

167
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,513
- Normally one could well … ow!
- Dad!

168
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,359
- Ow, ow, ow!
- What's happening?

169
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,711
It's the back.
I'm going to the chiropractor now.

170
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,310
- I'll call a taxi.
- Ow, ow, ow!

171
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,590
Uh … what is it again?

172
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,870
Our, yes.

173
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,994
Josephine's dad.
In God's name, heal that man.

174
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,111
- It takes a bit more than that.
- Stand up. You are healed.

175
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,995
I've had it 1000 times.
I need to go to the chiropractor.

176
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,953
Dad, stand up.

177
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,835
Wow, that's wild.

178
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,318
- It's completely gone now.
- That's why they call him Jesus.

179
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,469
I mean, Jesus with the magic hands.
No, come on.

180
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,911
- You promised to play Kalaha.
- In a bit.

181
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,911
They sure got
something to think about, huh?

182
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,999
- Was that wrong of me?
- No, that was fantastic.

183
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,156
You think so?

184
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,750
Shall we pray together?

185
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,278
Dear God.
Thank you for letting me sleep here tonight.

186
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,315
Thanks to Josefine for being so sweet.
Thanks to Lukas for a good game of Kalaha.

187
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,593
- May he get better at losing.
- I can handle losing.

188
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,756
Lukas, sleep.

189
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,915
I'm praying that I may
get home safely tomorrow. Amen.
