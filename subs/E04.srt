1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,234
Are you sitting comfortably in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,159
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,437
"What fortune
that the angels came and warned us."

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,156
12-year-old Josefine doesn't think it's
fun to have her birthday on Christmas Eve.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,033
If only she could find
a way to move Christmas.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,631
But it's hard when Christmas is Jesus'
birthday, and your mom is a priest.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,628
Don't you think Mary fooled around
with some other guy besides Joseph?

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,753
- I'm a priest, after all.
- But you're a modern priest.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,159
In Thorsen's shop, they find all sorts of things
they can use for the nativity play.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,278
Tunics.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,950
And Josefine shows Oskar
the mysterious nativity play.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,991
What do you say then?

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,038
Try to see.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,438
- Oskar wants to ask something important.
- Would you like to go steady?

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,077
But in her evening prayer, she prays that
Oskar won't be too upset.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,273
Because she has to say
that she doesn't want to be his girlfriend.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,517
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,156
laid in the soil like flower seeds

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,434
shoots and sprouts and winds around

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,350
she understands nothing at all

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,473
hours feel like days

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,309
and weeks a thousand years

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,999
came to look back

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,909
to a world of yesterday

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,716
Jesus and Josefine

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,391
homeless heartache

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,913
but Jesus makes Josefine

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,635
believe in miracles

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,559
when she wavers

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,470
Jesus and Josefine

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,151
faithless time machine

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,229
tempter's concubine

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,231
she needs miracles

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,393
when she wavers

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,993
- Oh, it's December fourth.
- Why "oh"?

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,352
So there are still twenty days left
until Christmas.

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,590
Now you've got some pine needles in your hair.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,190
Actually, I really
liked your raisin buns.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,517
Then you have to taste these.
Come here. Ow…

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,631
(groans)

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,991
These are the same,
just with star anise.

42
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,796
I call them friendship buns.
I always got them from my best friend.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,796
Look here, Josefine.
There's a letter from the Church Ministry.

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,908
When I write to them,
it always takes a month.

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,759
That's also because this is important.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,597
Okay, listen.

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,599
"Dear Josefine. We have decided
that it's a really good idea, -

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,155
- and therefore we're moving Christmas Eve."

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,830
- That's not true, is it?
- May I see that?

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,792
That's probably not exactly what it says.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,959
"Dear Josefine. We have
assessed the case and have decided, -

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,517
— that we cannot comply with
your request to move Christmas Eve.

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,713
We apologize and wish you
a happy birthday on 24/12."

54
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,592
Aw.

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,473
If you're grumpy,
just stick some fir in your hair.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,989
(phone rings)

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,036
Have you thought about it,
I asked you about yesterday?

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,993
Not right now.
Can't we talk about it later?

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,398
No, hello, Mary and Joseph.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
You look fantastic.

61
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,038
- I think that's how they looked.
- Most of it is pretty old.

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,279
- Are you sure we can borrow all that?
- Yes, Thorsen has loads of it.

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,756
- What is this?
- King Herod is supposed to wear that.

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,713
- You can forget that.
- Come on, Emilie.

65
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,074
- I'm not going to look like a clown.
- You won't, Emilie.

66
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,195
I've once seen Herod depicted.
He wore a garment like that.

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,152
You take it.

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,189
Then I just need the wings,
and I'm an angel.

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,112
You must say thank you to your friend.
This is way too much.

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,150
Are you ready for the last scene?
Then we just need to get the box out of the way.

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,911
That's where Joseph and Mary
have traveled to the land of Egypt -

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,318
- with the little Jesus child
and live a life as refugees.

73
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,232
And one day Joseph gets a visit from an angel.

74
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,075
Here you go.

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,353
Get up, Joseph of Abraham's lineage.

76
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,511
Take the child and its mother with you
back to the land of Israel.

77
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,953
For the one who wanted to kill the child,
is himself dead.

78
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,114
Maria, King Herod is dead.

79
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,348
- Is that true?
- We're going home. Home to Nazareth.

80
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,830
- What about this one?
- Her name is Josefine.

81
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,269
It's because you were
born in December, -

82
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,358
- and all the good ones are too.

83
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,117
Hi, Josefine.

84
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,999
I've thought about what you asked.

85
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,229
I think I'd mostly like
us just to be friends.

86
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,473
I don't think I'm in love.

87
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,110
I don't feel like
us just being friends.

88
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,517
- Why not?
- Because …

89
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,758
(door slams)

90
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,279
(doorbell rings)

91
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,832
Well, bye, Josefine.

92
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,794
- How did it go with the costumes?
- It went just fine.

93
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,589
Why are you so sad?

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,439
- Something with Oskar?
- How can you tell?

95
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,155
I have eyes in my head.
What's wrong?

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,316
He doesn't want to be friends anymore.

97
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,590
Well, nothing else?

98
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,715
Nothing else? We're best friends.
We've always been friends.

99
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,119
Josefine, now I'm going to
entrust you with a secret.

100
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,269
Try to look at me.
I have a reasonably good life.

101
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,995
- I think so myself, at any rate.
- And?

102
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,830
And I've lived a long life
without having friends.

103
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,750
Come on, Thorsen. Haven't you missed
having a really good friend?

104
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,555
I would think it was terrible
not to have a good friend.

105
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,275
That's how we're so different.
You know what?

106
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,990
Don't you feel like watching the bitch,
while I run a couple of errands?

107
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,395
- Yes.
- Thank you.

108
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,951
There.

109
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,311
(door creaks)

110
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,193
(wind chimes start)

111
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,192
Thorsen?

112
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,355
What's all this about?

113
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,996
Are you messing with me?

114
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
(knocking sounds)

115
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,795
(chickens clucking)

116
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,235
Tell me, is this Afghanistan?

117
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,235
They're playing Kalaha.

118
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,957
Jesus.

119
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,233
Jesus?

120
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,829
Then come and do your work.

121
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,875
- Don't cheat while I'm gone.
- We won't touch the game. Right, Simon?

122
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,311
- I don't trust you, Judas.
- Then it's now, Jesus.

123
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,915
Jesus?

124
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,515
- You have to hold on.
- I'm holding everything I can, Josef.

125
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,679
- Aren't you sweet calling me dad?
- Mom says I mustn't.

126
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,995
- You have to hold on!
- Now he mustn't overexert himself.

127
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,192
So you have to keep an eye on him.
He's just playing Kalaha.

128
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,029
Have you started the game again?
What do you think your dad will say?

129
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,789
- That you have to finish this one.
- I'm not talking about you, Josef.

130
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,549
- I'm talking about Him in Heaven.
- He gave me permission.

131
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,514
You know you're not allowed to lie.
You've gotten lazy lately.

132
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,998
- Go sit and practice your prayers.
- No, now he stays here.

133
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,674
- Who are you?
- Get out of here!

134
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,950
What are you going in there for?

135
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,829
This is a private stable, after all.

136
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,436
What kind of woman was she?

137
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,232
- Let's get back to work.
- She can't just disappear.

138
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,675
Jesus ….

139
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,236
Strange things happen to our family from time to time.

140
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,113
The best thing is not to
think about it.

141
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,393
Think instead about how you
plane a board so it becomes straight.

142
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,910
(doorbell rings)

143
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,149
Hi, Josefine.
Have there been any customers?

144
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,151
- What does that mean?
- There haven't been any.

145
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,312
Someone came for a Christmas star.

146
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,234
- We don't have any of those.
- That's what I said too.

147
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,670
Thanks. Hope it hasn't
been boring.

148
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,510
Not at all.
It's been quiet and peaceful.

149
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,678
Is something wrong?

150
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,471
No no.

151
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,314
I was just thinking about that nativity play.

152
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,988
Yeah, we won't touch that, right?

153
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,992
Now you'll see.

154
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,110
- I have to slip away. Bye.
- Bye bye. You're always welcome.

155
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,113
Look at you, you've started
to take an interest in the Bible.

156
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,279
- Isn't there more about Jesus as a child?
- Yes, there's the Christmas story.

157
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,950
No, not when he was really little,
More when he was my age.

158
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,948
There's actually not much,
but the Gospel of Luke has a story, -

159
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,151
- from when he's 12 and gets lost.

160
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,557
But Joseph and Mary find him
in the temple with the priests.

161
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,115
Is there really nothing more?

162
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,312
It's a long period
that we don't know much about.

163
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,239
- How wild.
- It's actually pretty wild.

164
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,474
He doesn't look like that at all.

165
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,673
All those pictures of Jesus were made
hundreds of years later.

166
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,358
- I think he was red-haired.
- No, he definitely wasn't.

167
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,155
- I don't think he was.
- But you can't know for sure.

168
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,672
What I believe can be
just as good as what you believe, right?

169
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,638
Dear God, or whoever is out there.

170
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,072
If everything that happened today
down at Thorsen's was real -

171
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,149
- and not a dream,
then I'd like to visit Jesus tomorrow.

172
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,432
- Can I come too?
- Lukas, go to sleep now.

173
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,835
I'm already looking forward to it, Amen.
