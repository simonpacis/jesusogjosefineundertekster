1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,109
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,710
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,592
Okay.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,510
Simon and Judas get a tip from Joshua.
Jesus is in the Roman city of Caesarea.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,439
He thinks he's free,
but he's captured.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,553
- Then we must free him.
- Only one can free Jesus.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,955
But there's only one who can help.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,518
The girl from the North.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,315
- May we spit on the prisoner?
- Then spit. And spit for me too.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,512
Josefine and Oskar visit Jytte.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,679
She gives Josefine a package,
that she got from an angel.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,917
It can only be opened,
when she is really in need.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,712
And I mean "really",

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,592
— Don't touch the overseer's property.
- The overseer is a fool!

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,954
Oskar sacrifices himself and lets himself be captured,
so Josefine can get up to Thorsen.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,550
She enters her old apartment,
which Thorsen has taken over.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,116
I had expected
you to have come a bit earlier.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,357
He thanks her,
because she got Jesus to give up.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,278
You have changed the world.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,552
Josefine finds the nativity scene game.
Thorsen tempts.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,073
I can do more for you and your family
than you ever dream of.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,669
But Josefine doesn't let herself be tempted.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,672
No!

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,555
Together with Simon and Judas
she goes out to find Jesus.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,070
- I'll pack some bread for you.
- I'll remember this one.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,997
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,636
laid in the ground like flower seeds

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,073
shoots and sprouts and winds around

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,831
she understands nothing at all

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,999
hours feel like days

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,476
and weeks a thousand years

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,519
came to look back

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,474
to a world of yesterday

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,708
Jesus and Josefine

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,198
homeless heartache

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,474
but Jesus gets Josefine

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,877
to believe in miracles

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,117
when she wavers

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,996
Jesus and Josefine

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,637
faithless time machine

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,437
the tempter's concubine

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,677
she needs miracles

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,799
when she wavers

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
(muffled explosions)

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,596
Psst!

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,196
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,276
Boy without a number, have you seen 47?
We can't understand where she is.

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,836
She has to show up at work soon,
otherwise the overseer will go mad.

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,793
- She's left.
- You can't leave from here.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,512
She's gone away
to make the world better.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,996
There is no better world.

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,794
She's at least
gone down to clean up.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,516
- Now she's gotten herself into something.
- Yeah, she baked a cake in it.

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,998
Did she bake a cake?
Only the high priest is allowed to bake cake.

55
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,678
If the angel is with her,
she can overthrow the high priest.

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,713
Watch what you say.
Think if he hears you.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,754
We haven't heard anything at least.
Come here, 58.

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,749
I have something for you.

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,318
Thanks,

60
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,956
- I can't go on anymore.
- Come on, Judas. We're almost there.

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,278
- I have blisters all over.
- You can walk even if you have blisters.

62
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,152
Why should she decide?

63
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,069
Remember what the old one said.
Only the girl from the North can free Jesus.

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,669
- That's surely nonsense.
- Now you stop.

65
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,237
Stop now. Then we'll sit down
and take a break and eat breakfast.

66
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,868
Judas, give us the loaves right away.

67
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,078
- Uh …
- Uh what, Judas? Have you lost them?

68
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,353
- Then you have to get some.
- Can you see any bakery?

69
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,030
- That's not funny.
- You don't need to scold me.

70
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,639
I'm not scolding.

71
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,195
- Stop and come see.
- See what?

72
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,198
Caesarea. It's right there.

73
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,274
Fantastic.

74
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,591
(gladiator clears his throat)

75
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,876
(growls)

76
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,358
(Jesus roars)

77
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,919
That's what happens when little boys
want to play with the big ones.

78
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,871
- Welcome to the gladiator school.
- Thanks, Pardos.

79
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,233
- I hoped we wouldn't meet.
- I want to be the king of the gladiators.

80
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,520
You've bound yourself to
a slave contract.

81
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,030
- Are you aware of that?
- Yes.

82
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,915
You risk being
beaten to death halfway.

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,710
- One would think you had run away.
- I have too.

84
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,830
I won't interfere in that.
As long as you understand, -

85
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,828
- that this is your life from now on.

86
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,598
Yes,

87
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,758
I expect
you're ready to sacrifice everything.

88
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,192
And you're ready to
hail the emperor of Rome.

89
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,552
Now I could slap you,
because you don't answer.

90
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,433
Do you know why I don't?

91
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,272
- You have a huge talent.
- Thanks.

92
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,598
Probably the biggest I've seen.
Now I was gentle with you.

93
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,636
Later we'll get to it.
You'll probably break an arm or a leg.

94
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,229
That's what it is to be a gladiator.

95
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,638
Jesus ….

96
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,030
- What are you doing here?
- We've come to save you.

97
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,198
- I don't want to be saved.
- You have to come with us.

98
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,109
The only thing I have to do is do
what's in the contract.

99
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,756
- I have to be here for ten years.
- You're not quite smart.

100
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,316
- You can't sign that.
- Do you get a lot of money?

101
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,718
- No, but I'll become famous.
- You're not going to be a gladiator.

102
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,152
Jesus, who are you chattering with?
Get ready for the fight.

103
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,909
- We'll pick you up tonight.
- No, you won't. Goodbye.

104
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,199
Now I'm looking forward to the transformation.

105
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,996
Will it come like a whisper of angels,
that hover across the sky?

106
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,478
Or do you think it comes
quietly and calmly, while we sleep?

107
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,470
- It might be that nothing happens.
- You don't think so? I hope so.

108
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,395
Now I think we're going to be set free.
I think that's the transformation.

109
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,113
Sit down. You're coming with.

110
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,516
Stand straight and receive your judgment,
boy without a number.

111
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,075
Listen to the overseer's words:

112
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,159
The right of the strongest sentences
the sub-subgod without number -

113
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,636
- to eternal forced labor
in the iron machines.

114
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,833
- Accept the judgment or die.
- Do you accept the judgment?

115
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,554
Do you accept the judgment? Come with.

116
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,150
Row then. You have to make the bulb light up.

117
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
And you keep rowing.
Otherwise you'll get the whip.

118
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,116
I'm keeping an eye on you.

119
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,595
(gong sounds)

120
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,917
So there's good news
for all gods.

121
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,395
The pressure is fine and stable, -

122
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,878
- so just keep scratching.
Then you'll get strength and freedom.

123
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,310
(sticks out tongue)

124
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,676
There.

125
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,349
(Josef hammers)

126
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,676
(Thorsen clears his throat)

127
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,755
Excuse me, is there something
we can help with?

128
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,589
I'm looking for a boy.
A very special boy.

129
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,510
Yes, we are too. That is,
his friends are out looking for him.

130
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,395
Is there among his friends
a strange girl?

131
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,551
Yes,

132
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,272
That's the one I've come
to warn him against.

133
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,472
Well, then you've come too late.
She's been here.

134
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,592
She's not to be trusted.
She fooled me.

135
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,990
That was just what I said. I said,
we shouldn't trust her.

136
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,714
Excuse me, who are you anyway?

137
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,878
I'm the one who came
to get revenge.

138
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,836
I've come
to collect my debt.

139
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,355
- My son doesn't owe you anything, does he?
- No no.

140
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,791
But she does.

141
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,789
- Do you know where they are?
— Yes.

142
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,678
They talked about Caesarea,
a Roman city down by the coast.

143
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,671
God bless you.

144
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,438
(thunderclap)

145
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,279
Thank you, ma'am.

146
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,278
Shut your mouth then.

147
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,432
(panting)

148
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,917
- There.
- That's fine, Judas.

149
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,955
- How do we get Jesus home?
- I think we should kidnap him.

150
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,393
No, that won't work.
Jesus has to come of his own free will.

151
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,830
Otherwise, he'll just run away again.

152
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,877
What about saying,
I've been bitten by a snake?

153
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,277
Then Jesus will have to
come to save my life.

154
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,631
- Bad idea, Judas.
- No, it's not a bad idea.

155
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,879
We'll make Jesus believe
he has healed Judas.

156
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,234
Jesus regains his faith, and then
maybe he'll realize who he is.

157
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,593
- Let's give it a chance.
- Come on.

158
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,109
Jesus?

159
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,797
Shall we fight?

160
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,118
- There are two who want to talk to you.
- Who are they?

161
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,552
Your friends say you have a sick
comrade lying out in the desert.

162
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,557
He asks for your help.

163
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,996
- Is it Judas?
- He has been bitten by a snake.

164
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,510
- Maybe he'll die.
- I'm not going to heal him. It's over.

165
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,432
- He just wants to say hi to you.
- Before he dies.

166
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,156
I have to fight.

167
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,678
Visit your friend. If you heal him,
it'll make you a better gladiator.

168
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,392
God be with you.

169
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,716
Who are you?

170
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,151
- I don't know if you dare to hear it.
- I dare to hear anything.

171
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,038
I am the Lord,
who created Heaven and Earth.

172
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,117
Are you God?

173
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,270
Are you hungry?

174
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,230
There.

175
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,120
You have to do me a favor.

176
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,277
I have decided
that Jesus shall not save the world.

177
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,598
He shall be a gladiator.
That's the best for him.

178
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,032
We all have to do what's
best for us. Do we agree?

179
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,390
Yes, if you say so.

180
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,195
You just make sure
he gets back to Caesarea.

181
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,077
Then I'll teach you
a little baking trick or two someday.

182
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,919
Judas?

183
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,190
Farewell, my friend.

184
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,035
Where were you bitten?

185
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,750
You were bitten just now.

186
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,672
- He doesn't look very sick.
- Yeah, he's about to die.

187
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,312
- Is that true?
- Nah, I'm perfectly fine.

188
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,313
Then why do they say
you've been bitten?

189
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,080
- I don't know.
- Judas.

190
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,352
- This is the second time you've lied to me.
- Sorry, but just hear me out.

191
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,554
- Are you going to fool me some more?
- I just came from the future.

192
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,959
Oskar has been taken prisoner,
and my parents have become slaves.

193
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,118
- Satan rules the world.
- Why should I care about that?

194
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,996
The future was changed because of you,
because you don't want to be God's son.

195
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,919
- I want to be a gladiator.
- Jesus is right.

196
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,352
If he wants to be a gladiator,
then let him be a gladiator.

197
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,279
Thanks, Judas.
You're the only one who understands me.

198
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,591
Shall we tie him up?

199
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,950
Just let him go.

200
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,708
Dear God, hear my prayer.

201
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,550
If I can't get Jesus
to understand, can't you?

202
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,075
But God wants
Jesus to be a gladiator.

203
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,516
How do you know?

204
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,710
I just know.

205
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,598
God, you are the only one
who can help Jesus. Amen.
