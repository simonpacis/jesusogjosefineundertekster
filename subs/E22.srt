1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,029
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,959
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,508
- You want him back too, right?
- Josefine has pitched camp in the desert.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,511
She and Simon and Judas
want to get Jesus out of gladiator school.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,393
- But Judas doesn't want to anymore.
- I'm going home now.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,398
- I'll come with you.
- Simon, you promised.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,910
He leaves the camp, and Simon goes with him.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,917
After a hard training session with Pardos
Jesus has a strange vision.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,272
He enters Thorsen's fireworks cellar
and sees how the world has changed.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,278
- Who are you?
- And then he meets himself as an adult.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,109
I am nothing. For the one
I was supposed to be, I will never become.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,437
Jesus realizes that he must be
the savior of mankind.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,710
See what happens.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,151
- I have to go.
- Sit in the cell and cool off a bit.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,920
He leaves
Pardos and the gladiator school.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,238
- I think I get it.
- But Thorsen captures Jesus.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,079
How strong are you, Jesus of Nazareth?

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,033
- He wants to throw him off a cliff.
- Stop!

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,752
- Are you threatening me with a feather?
- … an angel feather.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,999
Farewell, you mealworm.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,957
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,675
laid in the ground like flower seeds

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,954
shoots and sprouts and twines around

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,870
she understands nothing at all

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,959
hours feel like days

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,391
and weeks a thousand years

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,389
came to look back

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,388
to a world of yesterday

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,116
Jesus and Josefine

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,871
homeless heartache

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,393
but Jesus gets Josefine

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,831
to believe in miracles

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,032
when she wavers

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,870
Jesus and Josefine

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,596
faithless time machine

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,397
the tempter's concubine

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,672
she needs miracles

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,508
when she wavers

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
Good morning, Nazareth. Here we come.

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,518
My mom and dad
will be happy to see me.

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,870
I'll get such a big hug.

42
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,278
- Just say you've saved the world.
- Then I'll get an even bigger one.

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,399
— Just say goodbye.
— Do you want to be alone with her?

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,353
Do as I say now.

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,997
- Thanks for the ride, Josefine.
- Likewise. And thanks for the help.

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,757
- Goodbye, Josefine.
- Behave yourself now.

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,758
- What do you mean?
- I won't get involved in that.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,839
I will write down what we've experienced,
and sell it at the markets.

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,112
- That sounds like a bad idea.
- We'll mention the girl from the North.

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,754
What is meant to be remembered
will be remembered.

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,590
And that which is to be forgotten,
will be forgotten.

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,237
Welcome, Jesus. And sorry.

53
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,476
Sorry for what?

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,152
I went around looking for you,
but now I know I was looking too early.

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,194
You should be allowed to
grow up in peace.

56
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,790
But, Jesus …

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,759
- What does he mean by that?
- That you should forget everything.

58
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,033
- But we can become stonrich.
- Forget it, Judas. Come on.

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,071
Okay.

60
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,071
Come.

61
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,870
Joseph?

62
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,911
- Oh, are you there?
— Yes.

63
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,076
That was good.

64
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,392
Jesus?

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,673
Jesus! Oh, welcome, my boy.

66
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,632
My boy.

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,193
I've also been running around in the desert.

68
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,311
Are you hungry?

69
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,910
- Your mother has been so worried.
- Yes, I was worried.

70
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,590
I didn't know what to do.

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,870
My treasure.

72
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,718
Then I also want to say goodbye.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,870
Won't you eat with us?

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,515
- I have to go home.
- Are you really leaving?

75
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,552
Yes, my family has decided,
that we're moving on now.

76
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,589
You should at least have something
to strengthen you with before you leave.

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,518
Come. Sit down here,

78
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,514
It tastes absolutely fantastic.

79
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,712
It's just the food
that God has given me the skill to make.

80
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,198
- May I have another portion?
- You haven't been out in the desert.

81
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,675
That's why one can still be hungry.

82
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,190
Jesus' father only thinks about food.

83
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,435
Did you say "Jesus' father"?

84
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,954
I didn't notice that.

85
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,310
You actually said it.

86
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,910
You should just call me Joseph.
I know I'm not your father.

87
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,510
- But I want to call you father.
- Is that true?

88
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,756
Then I just have two fathers.

89
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,350
In return, I've thought about something.

90
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,838
Your mother is right.
You are something special. You should study.

91
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,429
You don't need to run around
patching wood together for me.

92
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,031
- But I want to be a carpenter.
- No, but you are the chosen one.

93
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,392
It will be a long time before he's called.
The beggar said it himself.

94
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,308
Jesus should be allowed to grow up first.

95
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,956
That suits me fine.
We have some big tasks right now.

96
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,151
We just shouldn't make crosses.

97
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,832
That otherwise pays well.

98
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,669
- We shouldn't make crosses for the Romans.
- I agree.

99
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,760
- They'll get furious.
- I'll find an excuse.

100
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,719
You don't need to, boy.
Dad will take care of it.

101
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,275
(laughs)

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,477
Josefine?

103
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,116
I'm sorry,
that I've been so harsh with you.

104
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,471
- I hope you can forgive me.
- Of course.

105
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,194
You're always welcome another time.

106
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,995
And if you need
some woodwork, I'm there.

107
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,556
- Yes, and my son here.
— Thanks.

108
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,315
- What is it?
- Just gifts. Also from my dad and mom.

109
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,751
- No, thanks a lot.
- You can open them on your birthday.

110
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,599
- How nice of you.
- It was the least we could do.

111
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,358
I must be on my way.

112
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,355
Take good care of yourself, my girl.

113
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,192
Safe journey.

114
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,474
- Can I just say goodbye?
- We'd like to join in too.

115
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,355
- No, Maria. Come on.
- You have to wave too.

116
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,232
Come on.

117
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,596
Well,
ah

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,992
- I could otherwise …
- I could otherwise …

119
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,272
I would otherwise
like to come along.

120
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,508
- You'd better not.
- I want to see if your family is okay.

121
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,713
- I hope they are.
- Are you scared?

122
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,234
When you're done saying goodbye,
will you come and help?

123
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,590
Yes, Dad.

124
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,594
- I'll miss you too.
- We can still think of each other.

125
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,438
Absolutely.

126
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,357
So say hi to
Oskar and Lukas and your dad and mom.

127
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,636
I will.

128
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,558
Trust in God.

129
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,313
- Why do you say that?
- I just couldn't help it.

130
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,834
Is something wrong?

131
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,156
Just trust in God.

132
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,031
You'd better take this too.

133
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,597
(cars honk outside on the street)

134
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,755
(doorbell rings)

135
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,431
- Merry Christmas.
— Yes, thanks. Same to you.

136
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,431
Merry Christmas.

137
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,914
(goats bleat)

138
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,556
- Hi, Josefine.
- Good to see you.

139
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,673
- Congratulations! You did it.
- It would never have succeeded without you.

140
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,749
- I think you took a long time too.
- It's easy to change the world, right.

141
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,475
Do you realize,
I was in that space machine for several days?

142
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,070
- How did the world become normal again?
- I woke up this morning.

143
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,636
- Then everything was as usual.
- Cool.

144
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,799
But there was goat shit at the goats',
so I need to get new straw.

145
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,595
- What did people say about it?
- No one remembers anything.

146
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,872
- Except for us two.
- How strange.

147
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,197
We're not in the Bible anymore either.

148
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,279
I can't find
a word about you and me or Lukas.

149
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,673
I'll miss the
girl from the North.

150
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,031
- You're not going back down there, right?
— No no.

151
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,595
Shouldn't we destroy the nativity play?

152
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,315
No, not right now,
but I promise to do it soon.

153
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,396
Why not right now?

154
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,628
I want to look at it one last time,
and burn it
and then it goes in the wood stove.

155
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,554
Then you really have to promise.

156
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,393
Oskar, wait a minute.

157
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,518
- I'd like to ask you about…
- What?

158
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,872
No, nothing.

159
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,074
Is it okay if I come
and pick up the nativity play a little later?

160
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,032
Yes yes.

161
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,470
Oskar?

162
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,319
Is it also okay if I change clothes
before I go home?

163
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,592
- See you,
- See you.

164
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,877
Hi, Lukas.

165
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,550
— Hi, dad.
- Hi, sweetie.

166
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,071
- Hi, mom.
- Hi. Lovely.

167
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,759
How glad I am
to see you all together again.

168
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,916
We're also glad to see you.

169
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,192
- You arrive just in time for dinner.
- Uhm, rice pudding.

170
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,836
There simply
wasn't any other food in the house.

171
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,873
The last few days have just flown by.

172
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,469
I think that's wonderful. Pine needles in your hair.

173
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,468
Pine needles in your hair? You're getting the hang of it.

174
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,918
- Weren't we going to have Nazareth juice?
- What is Nazareth juice?

175
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,669
We always drink Nisse's nisse beer.

176
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,396
- And why is your head so black?
- I've been rehearsing the nativity play.

177
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,275
I don't know any nativity play
that gets rehearsed this much.

178
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,393
It was because we tried to write
the girl from the North into the play.

179
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,513
Who is she? There's no
"girl from the North" in the Bible.

180
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,632
- Have you heard of her?
- The girl from the North?

181
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,352
- No.
- The girl from the North is my big sister.

182
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,917
- Oh, gosh.
- She taught Jesus to walk on water.

183
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,157
You really have
a lively imagination today.

184
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,916
(door creaks)

185
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,028
(glockenspiel starts)

186
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,913
Hey, stop that!

187
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,712
Hands off.

188
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,718
- I was down with Jesus.
- Yeah yeah, you were.

189
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,957
He was sitting with his elf hat
and eating rice pudding.

190
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,233
You don't say anything
to dad and mom about this.

191
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,795
- Is that understood?
- Okay.

192
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,915
(owl hoots)

193
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,790
Dear God, thank you,
because it's a normal Christmas again.

194
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,310
And sorry because I
haven't destroyed the nativity play.

195
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,718
I hope Oskar can forgive me,
because he's actually pretty sweet.

196
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,232
- Who's the cutest? Jesus or Oskar?
- Lukas, be quiet!

197
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,591
- Josefine is in love.
- Lukas!

198
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,913
I still hope
Oskar thinks I'm sweet. Amen.
