1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,360
Are you comfortably seated in front of the TV?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,393
Are you ready for a real Christmas story?

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,428
"Dear Josefine.
We have assessed the matter …"

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,031
Josefine receives a letter from the ministry,
which doesn't want to move Christmas.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,833
She tells Oskar she doesn't want
to get together. Oskar gets angry.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,759
Josefine gets sad.
She visits Thorsen.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,157
He asks her to mind the shop,
while he's out.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,753
Josefine can't keep her fingers from
the mysterious nativity scene.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,393
She gets sucked into the nativity scene —

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,428
- and lands in a stable in Nazareth.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,759
Josefine explores Nazareth
2,000 years ago.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,397
She sees Jesus as a 12-year-old
with Simon and Judas.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,956
You lazy rascal.
Can you come and do your work now.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,718
Jesus?

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,072
Jesus wants to know who she is.
But Maria chases Josefine away.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,316
Get away!

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,195
Jesus finds something on the ground.
Josefine's necklace.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,474
Back home, Josefine sees
a picture of Jesus as a 12-year-old.

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,032
He doesn't look like that at all.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,313
In her evening prayer, she asks
to come back and visit Jesus again.

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,112
I'm already looking forward to it.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,197
on her pillow thoughts stand in line

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,790
laid in the soil like flower seeds

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,120
shoot and sprout and twist around

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,836
she understands nothing at all

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,919
hours feel like days

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,669
and weeks a thousand years

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,554
came to look back

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,435
to a world of yesterday

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,634
Jesus and Josefine

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,038
homeless heartache

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,473
but Jesus gets Josefine

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,956
to believe in miracles

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,118
when she wavers

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,030
Jesus and Josefine

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,677
faithless time machine

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,317
tempter's concubine

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,478
she needs miracles

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,078
when she wavers

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,430
(panting)

41
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,959
What is that you have there? Get it away.

42
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,994
- It's just a thing I found.
- You got it from that weird one.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,395
Josef says I can keep it.

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,558
- Can he keep that one?
- What's wrong with it?

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,232
The problem is that it can tempt him
to do something he shouldn't.

46
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,317
Oh well.

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,916
As long as you have it cozy and good
and get your food on time, -

48
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,157
- you're indifferent to
whether Jesus fails God.

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,791
- Sorry.
- Josef!

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,472
You don't break the bread
without blessing it first, do you?

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,673
There's nothing to complain about,
if God leaves us one day.

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,631
Blessed are you, Lord, our God, -

53
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,355
- King of the universe,
who brings forth bread from the earth.

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,637
Thanks,

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
I just want to say, now the thing is gone.

56
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,991
God came and took it.

57
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,159
- Is that true?
- Of course it's true.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,397
You're cheeky enough,
but you don't lie, right?

59
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,355
Thank you, dear God, for teaching us
to understand what is good for us.

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,914
- Eight points.
- Lukas the elf says "eight points".

61
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,749
- What are you doing?
- Blind taste competition in elf beer.

62
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,871
Exciting.

63
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,556
- Six points.
- Six points, you say?

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,469
- Minus 13.
- Doesn't affect.

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,229
- Ten points.
- Ten? I think we have a winner.

66
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,957
This year's elf beer is:

67
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,958
The elf's elf beer from the Christmas Brewery.

68
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,038
Maybe that should go in your cookbook?

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,591
That's a good idea.
Then I can write about that time, -

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,314
- me and my friends helped
a lady up with …

71
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,637
We helped a lady carry
a piano up to the fifth floor.

72
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,230
It was summer,
and we were so thirsty.

73
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,479
So when we had carried the piano up,
she offered us something to drink.

74
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,309
She only had elf beer from the previous Christmas,

75
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,034
And that's not exactly what
one feels like in the summer.

76
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,276
But never has
elf beer tasted so good.

77
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,392
- Don't you think about anything else?
- Yes, rice pudding.

78
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,230
- You don't have to drink it.
- You have to in this family.

79
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,637
- What's wrong with you?
- Josefine is grumpy.

80
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,118
I'm not grumpy.
Oskar and I argued yesterday.

81
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,276
- About what?
- Nothing.

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,914
- She's grumpy.
- Stop it, Lukas.

83
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,350
Hi, Oskar. Shall we walk together?

84
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,316
- I don't know.
- I experienced something totally wild yesterday.

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,670
Then tell it to someone else.

86
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,231
- Don't you want to hear it?
- Nah…

87
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,989
You know what?
Then it doesn't matter either.

88
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,751
- Come, shepherds, let's find the child.
— You're holding those staffs all wrong.

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,511
- You have to hold them like a walking stick.
- Where do you know that from?

90
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,715
I've seen it in movies.

91
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,552
(the bell rings)

92
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,354
One moment.

93
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,439
The shepherds can decide for themselves
how to hold their staffs.

94
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,030
As long as the good message
gets through, right, Josefine?

95
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,430
Can you all have a blessed weekend?
See you on Monday and we'll practice more.

96
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,793
Oskar, are you still
upset about yesterday?

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,434
Nah.

98
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,076
- Is anyone coming along for the steak?
- We can do that.

99
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,589
(doorbell rings)

100
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,917
Thorsen?

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,553
(snoring)

102
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,439
(glockenspiel starts)

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,194
(Maria hums)

104
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,835
- Judas, now you owe me a shekel.
- What do you mean?

105
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,158
- You cheated. I've never cheated.
- Judas …

106
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,430
May I play?

107
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,918
- Who are you?
- I'm Josefine.

108
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,237
- This isn't for girls.
- Are you afraid of losing, Jesus?

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,829
(laughs)

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,754
- How do you know what my name is?
- I just know.

111
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,840
- We'll play a single game.
- Okay.

112
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,513
- What does "okay" mean?
- It's fine. You start.

113
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,790
- Okay.
- Beat her then, Jesus.

114
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,955
You owe her a shekel.

115
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,479
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me. You won it.

116
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,558
Are you actually his disciples?

117
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,274
- Disciples?
- We're his friends.

118
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,268
Simon and Judas. Why did you have
that strange clothing on yesterday?

119
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,552
- That's how we dress where we're from.
- Where are you from?

120
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,550
- A country far to the north.
- Farther away than Rome?

121
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,992
- Near where the world ends?
- No, that's not how the world ends,

122
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,555
- The earth is round.
- What kind of earth?

123
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,190
- Just forget it.
- Aren't you going home?

124
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,075
I think it's you who should go home
and study the ten commandments.

125
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,952
- You should go home now.
- Okay.

126
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,717
I still don't quite get
what "okay" means.

127
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,592
Come.

128
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,317
What are you actually doing here?

129
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,711
Me and my parents
are on our way to Jerusalem.

130
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,908
And we've pitched camp a bit from here.

131
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,112
- My mom thinks you'll tempt me.
- With what?

132
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,870
- She says it belongs to Satan.
- It doesn't.

133
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,039
- What were you doing in the stable yesterday?
- I was hiding.

134
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,437
- We couldn't find you.
- I'm good at hiding.

135
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,756
My mom mustn't see you.

136
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,508
My mom mustn't see this either.

137
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,675
This is Pardo.
He's a gladiator from Rome.

138
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,429
- He's the strongest.
- You like gladiators.

139
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,074
I like Pardo.
He defeats everyone.

140
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,517
- Do you want to be a gladiator yourself?
- I just never want to kill anyone.

141
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,276
- Are you allowed to have guests by your mom?
- It's just Josefine.

142
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,359
She's on her way to Jerusalem
from the country to the north.

143
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,039
Josefine? Josef-ine.
What a pretty name.

144
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,596
- I'm just called Josef.
- Hi, Josef.

145
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,679
If I promise not to tell,
can you do me a favor?

146
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,553
Let's hear it.

147
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,276
You don't have to do anything special.
It's just for me and my friends.

148
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,911
He did it again. My boy.
The water turned to wine.

149
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,318
How cool.

150
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,954
If mom sees it, she'll be furious.

151
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,712
I must not misuse my powers.
I'm the son of God, she says.

152
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,273
Can you fill
this up with apple juice?

153
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,314
- What is apple juice?
- You just have to think "apple juice".

154
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,078
Try tasting it.

155
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,352
It tastes good.

156
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,279
- Jesus?
- I have to go now.

157
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,759
- Hope we see each other again.
- Okay.

158
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,637
Josefine? I had no idea you were here.

159
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,198
I was just checking.
I'll come back tomorrow.

160
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,516
Whoa whoa, you dropped something.

161
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,234
What the hell?

162
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,115
A silver shekel. From Galilee.

163
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,237
You don't see one of those every day.

164
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,432
It's my lucky coin.
I got it from my dad.

165
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,200
I see.

166
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,190
When you have one like that, you really feel
the thrill of history.

167
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,437
Wonder who held
it in their hand?

168
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,877
- Yeah, it's not good to know.
- Hope it brings luck and happiness.

169
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,590
— We shall eat from the same dish.
- No, Lukas.

170
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,519
No, are we having rice pudding?

171
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,792
- There's enough for two days.
- I promised it to Lukas.

172
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,788
Would you mind grabbing
the Nazareth juice from the fridge?

173
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,514
Nazareth juice? What is that?

174
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,635
You drink it with the rice pudding.
You always do before Christmas.

175
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,552
Thanks,

176
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,912
Here.

177
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,716
Do you hate Christmas so much you've forgotten
that Nazareth juice exists?

178
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,150
This is just apple juice.

179
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,558
At Christmas we call it Nazareth juice.
It was something Jesus drank.

180
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,031
- Where do you know that from?
- It's in the Bible. Everyone knows that.

181
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,755
You don't put apple juice
into old leather bags, -

182
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,316
- because then the bags burst,
and the apple juice is wasted.

183
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,957
You put apple juice into new bags,
so both are preserved.

184
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,391
- Matthew, chapter nine, verse …
— 17.

185
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,878
So what happened to gnome beer?

186
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,072
— Gnome beer?
— Yeah.

187
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,558
Gnomes would never think of
drinking anything but Nazareth juice.

188
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,434
There was once,
me and some of my friends -

189
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,108
- had to carry
a piano up to the fifth floor.

190
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,676
It was in the summer.
It was insanely hot.

191
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,237
After we carried the piano up,
we were simply so thirsty.

192
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,116
Then she only had a crate of
old Nazareth juice from the previous Christmas.

193
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,711
That's not exactly what you need
after moving a piano.

194
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,629
Nazareth juice has never tasted so good.

195
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,274
Totally spruce in the hair. Cheers.

196
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,471
Josefine. Cheers.

197
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,236
Dear God.

198
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,389
Or whoever is up there.
It's just been the wildest day.

199
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,230
If you can abolish gnome beer, -

200
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,672
- then maybe
you can make the rice pudding disappear.

201
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,792
I'll ask Jesus about that tomorrow.

202
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,993
- What do you want to talk to Jesus about?
- Just go to sleep now, okay?

203
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,557
Lukas, I think you've eaten
your last portion of rice pudding.
